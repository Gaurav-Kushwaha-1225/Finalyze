Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

<a id='df79f01c-fe7b-4606-ac29-0acb6c7386ac'></a>

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.

<a id='e79f8351-39da-4566-8c47-ae3abc57575c'></a>

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

<a id='25064b95-b68f-42a1-9a93-a24df0faa71e'></a>

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<a id='df640738-430b-4ddc-8f73-3d150a2b3368'></a>

**Basis for Opinion**
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

<a id='2c8fd3d0-ef71-47be-9200-e68bc2cbf41d'></a>

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Description of the Matter

Content Amortization
As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming ("Content"). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.

<a id='93708a8a-cece-4843-8b2c-9f718aeef906'></a>

Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.

<a id='c363038e-7fd7-4ed6-a94e-cdd9ba34fa88'></a>

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

<a id='7eaba410-011a-44c3-8b5c-f57aab9291bd'></a>

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.

<a id='aa4f9f8a-c2ab-4094-a5be-8240655b5690'></a>

To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions.

<a id='47eff603-1bec-44c2-919e-38867abc3cdb'></a>

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.
