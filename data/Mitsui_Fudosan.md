## What is the vision Mitsui is aiming for?

### About Mitsui
Mitsui has long been providing the fundamental functions of a traditional trading company, such as trading, supply chain management, and risk management, as its core functions, and has constantly and unwaveringly refined and expanded these. In the process, we have leveraged our global networks to unearth and seize business opportunities, and have "created, grown, and extended" businesses. Through this, we have continuously and dynamically transformed our business portfolio. This kind of transforming in itself sums up the essence of how Mitsui conducts its business. As represented by such an ever-transforming business portfolio, Mitsui is constantly evolving, and it is a business entity that continues to grow while unceasingly refining its long-standing core functions.

<a id='a0993286-0470-4ad0-90ff-93d0aa5fdadf'></a>

### Aiming to be the Partner of Choice

Since its establishment, Mitsui has continued to provide _real solutions_ to social issues around the world through its business activities. As social issues are becoming ever more complex and difficult to overcome, we leverage our core functions and business portfolio that span globally across industries, and apply the expertise gained from these to our cross-industry initiatives. This is how we provide solutions designed specifically for each customer, region, and industry. Furthermore, these solutions can also be horizontally rolled out to other regions and industries. For example, when we decide to roll out a solution to other regions, we first seek to gain a deep understanding of and insight into the region to make sure we can provide tailor-made, _real solutions_ that match regional characteristics, culture, and the level of industrial development. By building a track record of such value creation and trust, we strive to be the "Partner of Choice" around the world.

<a id='2182fa47-276e-46f5-8735-0a14a852356b'></a>

## Human Resources and Corporate Culture
The foundations of our value creation are human resources and corporate culture. While each of our employees demonstrates high-level functions, they never stop making efforts to accumulate more expertise, refine their skills and knowledge on their own accord, and cultivate their professional capabilities. When such independent employees respect one another and are formed into teams, collaborative initiatives that transcend industries or regions naturally emerge. What fundamentally supports this organic cycle is our free and open-minded corporate culture. In fact, our employees have a lot of experience in creating innovation from the combination of efforts across regional and business axes, and they share these experiences within the Company. Such human resources and corporate culture are the most important strengths behind our value creation.

Looking back on the first year of the Medium-term
Management Plan (MTMP) 2026, what is your assessment
of the current operating environment and the Company's
achievements?

<a id='9dc3f2fb-6a7e-4e88-a18c-b10e5360a560'></a>

## Operating Environment
It remains highly likely that geopolitical risk, supply chain disruptions, and other supply concentration risk will further increase, and we are closely monitoring these risks along with macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As the scarcity of materials and services, such as mineral and metal resources, energy, basic materials, food, and healthcare, increases from a long-term perspective, I believe we have a significant role to play in responsibly building and managing stable supply chains.

<a id='74515477-e3d8-4807-9938-597fb3bd6fc4'></a>

Moreover, from a sustainability perspective, the significance of climate change and human capital has further increased.

In that regard, we will actively drive our initiatives towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 as well as our HR policies to maintain and enhance the Company's competitiveness through the effective recruitment, development, and promotion of diverse personnel worldwide. Mitsui has a high degree of awareness regarding natural capital, human rights, and supply chain issues, and is taking initiatives in these areas.

<a id='c97aee59-97bf-415e-8a13-5b4e2e26cce8'></a>

Review of the First Year of MTMP2026 and Achievements
We have achieved Core Operating Cash Flow of around one trillion
yen for three consecutive years, and profit is also at a historically
high level. This is the first achievement. These figures represent the
fruition of various company-wide initiatives, which include improving
the quality of our business portfolio, integrated risk management,
capturing upsides and responding to downside risks according to
the operating environment, as well as across-the-board middle game*

<a id='1905a19d-14bb-4247-87b5-62202009ccf3'></a>

endeavors that lead to the enhancement of existing businesses.
I want us to continue to refine these initiatives for further growth.

* The intermediate stages between the entry and exit points of investments, where the focus is on
enhancing individual businesses and implementing turnarounds to improve earnings power.

<a id='18b40768-e574-41a4-9b0c-fd9122cb69ca'></a>

The second achievement is the progress in investments for growth. Since the previous MTMP period, we have been pursuing potential investment projects and investment themes that will lead to the next level of growth. As a result, we now have a rich pipeline of projects and have a vantage point to carefully assess which projects are to be prioritized. I have the sense that executing investments of one trillion yen annually is only possible when we are able to carefully select high-quality projects from an investment pipeline several times larger. In that sense, our investment plan is highly feasible, backed by a rich pipeline of projects.

<a id='e66111c9-048b-43bb-aa5f-cf96e5f38d0f'></a>

The third achievement is the change in the execution structure.
We have made progress in establishing a structure that enables

<a id='b63c2c00-d86f-4535-a946-4a4e4251499d'></a>

initiatives that transcend multiple units and divisions. This has
facilitated the provision of cross-industry *real solutions*, along with
the three Key Strategic Initiatives outlined in the MTMP, and we are
beginning to see the fruition of value creation unique to Mitsui.
In addition, we have changed our governance structure this year.
As CEO, I am able to gain a great deal of insight from our Board of
Directors in leading the Company towards sustainable growth.
We are constantly reviewing and transforming our governance
structure to further reinforce a mechanism that enables rich and
constructive discussions, fully incorporating the diverse expertise
and experience of our External Directors.

<a id='9e286962-ad68-46d8-8181-e1b6d4ac3a3b'></a>

## Towards Further Growth

While I am confident about many of our achievements and solid progress towards sustainable growth, we aim to further expand our cross-industry initiatives. The value we create by combining trading company functions and global expertise across various industries can be called a "cross-industry premium," and in an uncertain world that requires constant innovation, its value will only increase. Given the quality improvement of our business portfolio and progress in investments for growth and initiatives across organizational boundaries, I am confident that we can generate further cross-industry premium in many more business areas. In this regard, as CEO I am determined to lead the Company to further unleash our potential.

<a id='0541fc37-58ba-4dc6-b4ea-c1ab4c1d6496'></a>

Please tell us about Mitsui's portfolio management.

Strengths of Our Portfolio Management
Our portfolio management has three strengths. The first is related to the timeline of projects. We engage in projects where we target near-term earnings contribution, as well as projects that will solidify the earnings base over the long term. The same goes for our project pipeline. The second is that we have a well-balanced portfolio both

CEO Message
in developed and emerging countries, and that, in all regions,
we engage in businesses primarily through excellent corporate
consortiums. The third is that we first focus on familiar areas of
business where we have already accumulated expertise and then
combine this expertise into adjacent areas of business to generate a
cross-industry premium. This is also effective from the perspective
of minimizing our exposure to areas that are unknown for us.

<a id='505a4588-87c8-48b6-9213-2da309ce5b16'></a>

Our business portfolio has been built over time by leveraging these strengths, and it has become key to our integrated risk management in a business environment where various risk factors, such as geopolitical risk, country risk, and market risk, are intricately linked to one another. In other words, we diversify our business portfolio to reduce risk, to limit our exposure to unknown areas through the combining of expertise including that of our partners, and to enhance the effectiveness of our risk management.

<a id='4127d5f1-6edf-4ce0-b722-7b6f87bc88d9'></a>

Using both diversification of business portfolio and the combining of expertise, we are establishing a system that can achieve near-term earnings contribution and a long-term earnings base at the same time, while strengthening the downside resilience against changes in the operating environment. I believe we are making solid progress in these approaches.

<a id='0131d746-613b-4e2b-bbb2-affdc49dc49c'></a>

Furthermore, to strengthen the entire business portfolio, we always bear in mind the cost of capital and position ROIC as a key indicator from the perspective of enhancing cash generation capability. While considering ROIC improvement in accordance with the characteristics and risk profiles of individual industries, we are carefully tackling our business portfolio transformation. We will continue to pursue various forms of transformation and reinforce our strengths.

<a id='7229baac-c9fe-4766-9cfc-744893ad6e15'></a>

What Constitutes a Business Portfolio Unique to Mitsui
Our business portfolio is composed of many businesses unique
to Mitsui. Typically, such businesses are those born from collaborations
with long-term trusted partners, those in the areas where we have

<a id='8d3a9828-3084-4c23-9aeb-b2fba6bb4222'></a>

<::A man with gray hair and glasses, wearing a light brown blazer over a blue sweater, is speaking and gesturing with his hands.

White sofas or chairs are also in the background on the left. On the right, behind the man, a dark gray wall features a white geometric logo and the text "MITSUI & CO." below it. A dark table or counter with decorative items is in the foreground on the right. The overall setting is brightly lit.: figure::>

<a id='8fd416eb-5ed6-468b-bd48-2006d44287bd'></a>

accumulated expertise and a presence over a long period, and those
that combine functions and expertise across industries.

<a id='e8f89749-36ac-436b-94ab-17cd873db125'></a>

As an example of collaboration with a long-term trusted partner,
I would like to touch on our LNG project in the UAE. Since the 1970s,
we have been jointly managing an LNG project with Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (ADNOC), a leading company in the UAE's
energy industry. After over 50 years of engagement in this business,
we are now participating in a new LNG project in Ruwais, UAE, by
forming a powerful international consortium together with energy
majors. Mitsui's LNG business spans a total of 11 projects in 8 countries,
and each project has characteristics unique to Mitsui.

<a id='bb71d34c-c769-4e4d-8016-e5933f42dd9d'></a>

Also, as an example of a project that combines long-accumulated expertise and cross-industry functions and expertise, I want to touch on the clean ammonia business that we are jointly exploring with ADNOC. Mitsui has over 50 years of experience in ammonia trading and maintains a top share of about 60% of ammonia imports to Japan.

<a id='054326dc-217a-4f70-a6db-b6aac53a27a7'></a>

In addition, thanks to our experience in the operation of several ammonia production businesses as well as specialized vessels and tanks, we are well-versed in handling ammonia, a hazardous chemical. Furthermore, we have a long history of supplying LNG to Japan and other Asian countries. For the clean ammonia business, the combination of expertise in both chemicals and energy industries is essential, and this is a business unique to Mitsui that generates a premium through cross-industry initiatives.

<a id='97f446e3-9842-4ede-8aeb-93f9817e1452'></a>

## Business Portfolio Reconfiguration
To strengthen the entire business portfolio, reconfiguration of assets is also important. We typically hold assets while they are able to create value, and when the right time comes, we pass the baton to a third party who can responsibly continue the business and enhance its value. We then shift to different areas where we can create new value. We are constantly executing such dynamic,

expansion-style business portfolio reconfiguration, taking into account capital efficiency as well as business and regional axes.

<a id='61069657-3087-4f00-a2f9-9e29f7cc69b5'></a>

Examples of our expansion-style business portfolio reconfiguration include the Paiton coal-fired power plant project in Indonesia. Since the launch of the project in the 1990s, Paiton has significantly contributed to the local region through its stable operation and consistent power supply, while generating earnings for Mitsui over a long period. However, in consideration of current social issues and changes in the operating environment, we have sold the project to operators who can responsibly continue the business. In this way, we endeavor to align as closely as we can our holding period of the project with the period during which Mitsui can provide added value to society. We are currently in the process of starting up a gas-fired power generation project in Thailand, which will provide the same level of earnings that Paiton did prior to its sale. Over the

<a id='885ecc4c-a0f6-44f2-88af-fe2813e8b49e'></a>

energy projects to expand.

Leading the Organization and Employees as CEO
The leadership team, composed of Executive Committee members,
spearheads our corporate activities in managing the entire business
portfolio, promoting individual robust growth policies, and driving
our partner strategies. Furthermore, we continuously discuss and
update the Company's organization and mechanisms to maximize
employees' output. At the same time, the team is committed to
setting an example for employees and providing all necessary
support to them so that each individual with their unique personality

can effectively apply their expertise and insights professionally and
fulfill their potential across industries and regions.

<a id='4058f002-02db-4620-bd95-b77012783002'></a>

I also take advantage of various opportunities to communicate with employees in person, so that each and every employee can fully tap into their abilities and deliver results. Also, I frequently send messages to all employees to share my thoughts. I believe such efforts lead to the development of the next-generation leadership teams and ensure the continuity of management.

<a id='7ab3ca5b-fee2-401b-b85e-7ee0af425f27'></a>

**To Our Shareholders and Investors**
I place the utmost importance on having dialogue with our stakeholders, including shareholders and investors. The insights gained from engaging in dialogue with you are fully utilized for management improvement and are also incorporated into my communication with our employees.

<a id='1f45be4e-611a-4e6e-b784-56f01ead3959'></a>

Furthermore, we continuously work on both accumulating
projects capable of contributing to earnings in the near term and
building a solid business foundation for the future, in order to drive
the sustainable enhancement of corporate value. Our basic approach
to the Company's management remains unchanged: We will execute
a well-balanced allocation of the cash flow generated from these
endeavors to investments for growth and shareholder returns,
which include both stable dividends and flexible share repurchases,
and strive to simultaneously enhance earnings power and ROE.

<a id='65d899d9-b9fd-48e5-8988-2bf8bc42f2e8'></a>

By dynamically transforming our portfolio, creating a cross-
industry premium, and continuing to grow the Company, we hope
to be able to meet your expectations.

LNG and Clean Ammonia Initiatives in Abu Dhabi
Mitsui is pushing forward the energy transition worldwide with its global partners. The following section presents our LNG initiatives in Abu Dhabi, which span more than 50 years, and our new clean ammonia project. Clean ammonia refers to blue ammonia, where natural gas is used as a feedstock and CO2 emissions in its production process are reduced through carbon capture and storage (CCS), and green ammonia, where hydrogen produced from renewable energy is used as a feedstock.

Mitsui's Initiatives
in Abu Dhabi

<a id='0467004a-0f09-474a-ad38-9516186d5a00'></a>

In an era when Energy Business Unit earnings was dependent on oil trading, Mitsui invested in its first LNG business, which had high barriers to entry. By facilitating an agreement with Tokyo Electric, Japan's largest buyer at the time, and by providing financing, we earned the trust of ADNOC and energy majors, building strong partnerships. These relationships led to our subsequent entry into other LNG projects. Furthermore, the decision was made to invest in Ruwais LNG in 2024, the second LNG project in the country.

I have been seconded to ADNOC Gas as the Marketing Manager for Ruwais LNG. With a diverse team from the UAE, Europe, the US, and India, I have been leading marketing of Ruwais LNG and achieving key milestones by deploying my trading expertise, industry network, and frontline marketing skills that I have cultivated during my career at Mitsui. For over 50 years since the 1970s, Mitsui has been building solid relationships and conducting interpersonal exchanges with ADNOC, which is an important supplier in the context of Japan's energy policy. Mitsui's investment in this project amid brisk competition among international energy majors is one crystallized outcome of this relationship. Looking ahead to the next 50 years, I will continue this contribution to building and leveraging Mitsui's presence in the Middle East region and the global energy industry.

Objective

Mitsui understands the importance and focuses on sustainability in its business. We have identified material issues ("Materiality") for the sustainable growth of both society and Mitsui, and these are the foundation of our business policies and strategies. We aim to contribute to our Mission "Build brighter futures, everywhere" through our businesses.

<a id='43e0308c-b16a-4901-a86e-117a6fe8e81f'></a>

# Identification Process

In identifying our Materiality, we consider each issue's impact on Mitsui and its stakeholders from the perspective of sustainable development of society and Mitsui with reference to the SDGs, the United Nations Global Compact, and other international frameworks. The identification process of our Materiality involves internal and external discussion, and approval from the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. Furthermore, we conduct a review of our Materiality every three to five years in light of changes in the operating environment and other factors to ensure that our Materiality incorporates contemporary social issues. In 2024, we started a review process from the perspective of double materiality (acknowledging the impact the environment and society has on our business, and the impact our business activities have on the environment and society), taking into account the opinions of our stakeholders.

Climate Change

<a id='e7a7ae9a-2862-454c-827d-456555bfc80c'></a>

## Governance
Mitsui has positioned addressing climate change as a key management issue. The Sustainability Committee, a sub-committee to the Executive Committee, plans, formulates, and submits proposals to the Board of Directors for resolution and reporting.

<a id='312f77bd-a244-4983-a1f7-9b7969f76599'></a>

In FY March 2024, the Sustainability Committee discussed a total of nine climate change-related topics, including expanding disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions, responding to the mandatory disclosure of sustainability information, reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, and deliberating on climate change response evaluation items as part of Performance-linked Restricted Stock-based Remuneration. These topics are being rolled out and disseminated throughout the Group through persons in charge of sustainability at the business units, each Corporate Staff Division, overseas regional business units, and regional blocs.

<a id='43a01e33-aaa8-43a3-a0ce-abc3efe336e6'></a>

Risk Management

We have established an integrated risk management system that centrally manages company-wide risks and have positioned climate change risk (physical and transition) as one of our material risks. We have taken measures that include visualizing risks through scenario analysis and introducing an internal carbon pricing system to be used in making decisions on execution of investments and loans and in risk assessments of existing businesses.

Scenario analysis
We conduct scenario analysis to prepare for changes in the global business environment. Particularly for businesses of high importance in terms of the amount of invested capital and the impact of climate change, we also analyze impact on profit as shown below and consider countermeasures.

For details on each business area, please refer to our sustainability data. In addition, we have established the following policy for the coal-fired power plant business and thermal coal mining.

<a id='867b09a2-3acd-4ce4-b3af-6427ec0110c0'></a>

Coal-fired Power Plant Projects and Thermal Coal Mine Projects Policy

Mitsui & Co., understands the governmental policies and targets that countries have set under the Paris Agreement and discussions taking place across the globe, and in that context we will conduct our business activities in accordance with the following policies.

*   We will not invest in any new coal-fired power plant projects. We are studying plans to exit from our remaining coal-fired power assets* by 2040. We take into account the responsibility of the current owners to address the impact on local communities of power purchase agreements which will continue into the 2040s, and to ensure appropriate returns for our shareholders, as preconditions for proceeding with exit.
*   We do not hold any thermal coal mine interests in the coal business. Our policy is not to acquire any new interests in thermal coal mines.

* Remaining coal fired power assets: Malaysia and Morocco

Business and Human Rights, Supply Chains

<a id='ca722671-78ac-456a-b858-6d5daf7a41e3'></a>

### Mitsui's Policies
We understand and support human rights as outlined in international standards* as a minimum standard. We have established a Human Rights Policy, Environmental Policy, and Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, and are working to capture and resolve environmental and social issues, including human rights issues, in the supply chain. With these efforts to respect human rights, we aim at reducing business risks and sustainable enhancement of corporate value.

<a id='f24a5140-e70b-433b-b749-f48b4b3fd1ab'></a>

<::Flowchart: Human Rights Due Diligence Process::>1. Formulation and announcement of Human Rights Policy, and incorporation into management systems: Commitment by management and oversight of progress by the Board of Directors. Concurrent engagements by business units to ensure and pursue effectiveness and efficiency.2. Implementation of Human Rights Due Diligence:    a. Awareness: Inform business partners of policies, raise awareness among business partners and employees, and conduct training.    b. Identification: Identify high-risk areas in our business.    c. Surveys: Conduct supplier surveys. On-site supplier visits.    d. Disclosure and improvements: Disclose survey results and propose improvements to suppliers. Improve survey methods.3. Corrective and remedial measures (Grievance mechanism): For suppliers whose response has been found to be inadequate through supplier surveys, on-site visits, or other methods, or for suppliers who have been suspected of having environmental or human rights issues, regardless of whether they have direct dealings with Mitsui, we will take corrective or remedial measures through appropriate processes.Dialogue with stakeholders: This element is shown interacting with all three main stages (1, 2, and 3) of the process.<::

## Enhancement of Human Rights Due Diligence

In FY March 2024, we reviewed high-risk areas subject to human rights due diligence with advice from external advisors. As a result, from FY March 2025 we will expand high-risk areas coverage, beyond the current scope that includes food materials, clothing, construction materials and others, to also include mining, metals, oil, gas, chemicals and other industries, as well as transactions involving products originating from emerging countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, and other regions. We are also working to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of surveys by improving survey items, introducing an online survey system aimed at improving the number of effective responses by suppliers, and creating a process for the evaluation of survey results.

In FY March 2024, we sent our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy to 4,468 new suppliers, held training (for which we invited an attorney with expertise in human rights issues) for approximately 400 people, including external suppliers. We also sent questionnaire surveys to suppliers of Mitsui and its consolidated subsidiaries and obtained responses. In addition, a subsidiary accompanied a customer on a follow-up audit of a tea plantation in Sri Lanka. During the prior on-site visit by external experts appointed by the customer, it was confirmed that appropriate initiatives were being implemented in areas such as management, health, safety and environment (HSE) measures, and provisions for first aid. However, items requiring improvement were found in some areas, such as work rules, labor contracts, and wages. Together with the customer, we held a series of dialogues with the plantation management and thereafter confirmed that improvements had been made.

<a id='266e4377-2b29-4755-be5c-8440d02957a1'></a>

We have also established a grievance mechanism and posted information on the Company website. During FY March 2024, we improved the content of the description, including the projected response time following receipt of a complaint. No complaints were received regarding human rights in the supply chain.

Environmental Assessments in the Supply Chain

Our questionnaire surveys cover environmental items in addition to human rights. For natural rubber, palm oil, lumber, and paper products, which can have high environmental impacts such as deforestation, we have formulated Procurement Policies for Specific Commodities, disclosed our targets and the results of traceability and procurement rates of certified products, and have made this information known to our business partners. In FY March 2024, Mitsui & Co. Seafoods, a consolidated subsidiary, formulated a procurement policy for marine products. Since the scope of environmental impact is wide-ranging, encompassing climate change, water resources, and biodiversity, we intend to increase the number of products subject to the Procurement Policies for Specific Commodities and will work with suppliers to promote environmental assessments in the supply chain.

Enhancement of Internal Processes and Measures to Raise Awareness

<a id='a9c36a5e-a08c-48b7-a1df-e315e00f83c7'></a>

In FY March 2024, we introduced a system of human rights auditing in internal audits as well as voluntary audits of affiliated companies, conducted by our business units. Specifically, we worked to reduce human rights risks, including those in the supply chain, by adding human rights clauses to product purchase agreements. In addition, business and human rights content was added to career stage training programs (for new recruits and line managers) as a measure to spread awareness.

Based on the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) recommendations, we have been progressing with the analysis of the nature-related dependencies and impacts of our business with a view to integrating nature-related elements into our strategy, promoting nature-related initiatives, and disclosing information. Referencing the TNFD guidance, we identified 10 key nature-related businesses, taking into account the amount of capital invested and the scale of their revenue (sales). We have designated businesses that contribute to reducing our nature-related dependencies and impacts as businesses with nature-related opportunities. Because location is important for nature-related risks and opportunities, we also conducted an analysis that took into account the local characteristics of each business location, and the LEAP approach *1 recommended by the TNFD for three businesses.

Furthermore, to utilize this information in project formation and assessments, we created a database of areas of high importance in terms of water risk and biodiversity, and have made a risk map available internally for use in natural capital risk analysis. Through these efforts, we intend to improve our business portfolio from perspectives of natural capital, while also contributing to achievement of Nature Positive*2 through business.

## Company-owned Forests: Mitsui's Forests

Mitsui owns approximately 45,000 hectares of forests in 75 locations throughout Japan. In FY March 2024, Kiyotaki Forest in Kyoto was certified as a Japanese "Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECM)" site, which will also contribute to the 30 by 30 global initiative. In addition, based on the results of applying the LEAP approach at Ishii Forest in Hokkaido, one of Mitsui's Forests in which we have achieved forest operations that enhance the value of natural capital, we evaluated its positive nature-related impact as well as its material risks and opportunities. We will continue to manage company-owned forests in a sustainable manner to contribute to ongoing biodiversity conservation and other positive impacts.

<a id='d27d6827-a742-4ee9-ac65-0c82f4ef36aa'></a>

Through deepening our sustainability management and optimizing our business portfolio, Mitsui will continue to evolve into a company capable of sustainably enhancing its corporate value to ensure its continuity.

<a id='0fda26b1-6639-47a2-9f33-e51464836c8e'></a>

What are your views on the deepening of sustainability management, one of the corporate strategies defined in the Medium-term Management Plan (MTMP) 2026?

<a id='f627ae9a-95b1-4d9f-8a80-0aea3b56c130'></a>

I am convinced that initiatives across entire value chains are needed to address climate change and issues relating to natural capital and business and human rights.

<a id='7b060a99-73c9-4f98-8460-153f4ea255cb'></a>

Our priorities concerning natural capital encompass its conservation and effective utilization. We have also prioritized initiatives to create economic value through the effective and sustainable utilization of natural capital, such as regenerative agriculture. We also analyze Mitsui's Forests* and our three business domains, based on the TNFD's LEAP approach, to address risks and opportunities.

<a id='3dfb5801-9aff-483a-bbe5-b091b30df4d8'></a>

Human rights are universal rights common to all people and are
non-negotiable and absolute. Under any circumstances, human rights
must be secured, and Mitsui is expanding the scope of its human rights
due diligence and strengthening its monitoring systems.

<a id='4da89f19-56ae-463c-b028-f544c5517bc1'></a>

Mitsui has identified its Materiality, which consists of five key material issues requiring prioritized actions through our business activities to ensure sustainability. We are currently reviewing Materiality to reflect changes in the nature of social issues and the views of our stakeholders.

<a id='3dc76bc6-1708-40cd-ab85-b874b0c5ac99'></a>

One of the goals set forth in MTMP2026 is the "fusion of business and sustainability." What changes does Mitsui need to make in its business portfolio from that perspective, and what progress has been made in terms of portfolio transformation?

<a id='9ebd6ebc-f148-4f21-b440-6656b7b6e852'></a>

We remain focused on ensuring Mitsui's continuity through business
portfolio optimization. Given the increasing volatility of the business

<a id='c451d7fc-a96b-49ef-b3b7-45dc45ba6fe3'></a>

environment, we aim to reinforce our risk resilience and achieve
sustainable enhancement of corporate value by optimally diversifying
our portfolio in terms of industries, regions, and timelines.

<a id='f9767fce-3d3d-4d82-aa3e-10d29b92cb75'></a>

As we transform our business portfolio, we believe it is essential to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition to reinforcing our natural gas and LNG business to support the transition phase, we are also planning to launch renewable energy and next-generation fuel projects. Furthermore, in the context of reducing our GHG emissions, we sold two coal-fired power plant projects in 2024.

Mitsui is accelerating both the speed and scale of this business portfolio transformation. Because of our growing confidence in our ability to expand cash generation capabilities and profitability, we have become able to take major steps both in terms of investments for growth in line with our three Key Strategic Initiatives outlined in MTMP2026, and the sale of some businesses based on our future outlook.

<a id='69cadbde-aba6-4d40-8b66-bf25a7eca37c'></a>

Mitsui has many projects that it has engaged in for many years,
including both in the operation of businesses and toward acquisitions
and sales. The Ruwais LNG project announced in July 2024 is
the culmination of our activities over 50 years in Abu Dhabi.
We have also realized the sale of the Paiton coal-fired power
plant project and the MRCE locomotive leasing business after
years of internal discussions.

<a id='dcf2687d-b362-4577-9438-50a77ff7eb4a'></a>

Mitsui's sustainability management is designed to achieve enhancement of corporate value from a long-term perspective. While strengthening existing businesses, we carefully select investments from a large number of candidates and consider the timing of their execution. We aim to create a business portfolio that combines both near-term and long-term stable cash flows, enhancing our cash generation capabilities and earnings power.

Mitsui's unique growth story—progress and results of our business portfolio improvement and *middle game* initiatives

<a id='d5d27c75-f274-4804-bf1e-b34235bfa810'></a>

What progress did Mitsui make in the first year of Medium-term Management Plan (MTMP) 2026, and what lies ahead?

<a id='5e4b79dd-d3e5-463f-aa4b-7f23786cf555'></a>

In FY March 2024, profit was 1,063.7 billion yen, exceeding one trillion yen for two consecutive fiscal years. Core Operating Cash Flow (COCF) was around the one trillion yen level for three consecutive fiscal years. Regarding the base profit enhancement target of 170 billion yen set out in the MTMP, by the end of FY March 2024 the progress was 55 billion yen. This was a result of what we call middle game* initiatives and the contribution to earnings from new investments beginning to appear. We also made progress in improving the business portfolio, with the steady execution of investments for growth that aim to contribute to near-term earnings as well as forming a long-term earnings base.

<a id='75bd5d45-6c8a-4f18-807c-01e99feb7fe2'></a>

* The intermediate stages between the entry and exit points of investments, where the focus is on enhancing individual businesses and implementing turnarounds to improve earnings power.

<a id='b283983e-b753-4126-b682-018132d9c04e'></a>

_Middle Game Initiatives_
Although people tend to focus on the entry and exit points of investments, the initiatives that really increase intrinsic value are the ones that occur at the intermediate stages—the stages of enhancing individual businesses and implementing turnarounds to improve earnings power. Mitsui’s leadership team has communicated the importance of winning this _middle game_, and have instilled this concept throughout the Mitsui & Co. Group.

<a id='5912accd-f07c-4b7d-ad75-05a040dd68f8'></a>

However, in light of the actual progress so far, I believe there is ample room for improvement in our _middle game_ initiatives. Each operating company is working to improve the level of its management

<a id='d9abe934-2ebd-415f-ba16-1daf7d9f64d3'></a>

by setting KPIs aligned with its current business stage. These KPIs include not only profit and COCF, but also measures of efficiency such as ROIC and ROE, or in some cases targets such as increasing EBITDA and valuation multiples. Due to the impact of individual operating environments, there are a certain number of loss-making businesses. Reducing the number of loss-making businesses can lead to an immediate contribution to earnings, so we will be bold in taking _middle game_ initiatives here.

<a id='264b93b2-6d7b-4c5d-9336-d44e4bdafd8a'></a>

### Improving the Business Portfolio

In addition to *middle game* initiatives, we will steadily accumulate new investments for growth that can begin contributing to earnings immediately after the investment is made, in order to enhance our earnings power. Furthermore, as an example of our efforts to establish a medium- to long-term earnings base, we are pursuing businesses related to decarbonization and next-generation fuels as part of the Global Energy Transition, one of the Key Strategic Initiatives of the MTMP. Some of these businesses will take time to generate earnings. Therefore, in reconfiguring our portfolio, there is a need to have a balanced combination of investments with a diversified range of timeframes related to earnings contribution. In this way, by combining the diversification of earnings contribution and cash flow timelines with the global geographic diversification across developed and emerging countries, and with the diversification of products and business areas, we are reinforcing our areas of strength and improving our overall business portfolio.

**What is driving the improvement of Mitsui's business portfolio?**
---
The frontlines in each business unit are setting their sights higher
for business portfolio improvement. I believe this is the result of
company-wide efforts to promote the use of ROIC as an efficiency
indicator, and to carefully select investments.

<a id='0f547273-d2b6-45f5-bc8d-1dc955e477e0'></a>

Effects of Introducing ROIC Management
There has been a significant effect from the widespread use of ROIC,
which was introduced in the previous MTMP as an indicator used
for discussing efficiency. The pursuit of efficiency is more deeply
entrenched in discussions between the leadership team and the chief
operating officers of business units. In discussions on achieving MTMP
targets for COCF and profit, ROIC enables us to visualize and discuss
the capital efficiency of each business area. As a result, I believe that
the level of management in each business unit has risen in terms
of pursuing capital efficiency. Moreover, a deeper understanding within
the Company of the cash flow allocation framework has established
a mindset of shifting to projects with higher profitability and growth
potential in order to improve the overall portfolio. In addition, when
verifying the justification for continuing to hold existing businesses,
we are carefully selecting investments that will grow into core
businesses in the future. We are raising the bar in looking at
investments from that perspective. As an example of the results of
this elevated focus on careful selection, we have been actively
reducing our holdings of listed stocks. For investments for growth
as well, as this focus is raised company-wide, there is greater
awareness of selecting higher-quality projects that transcend the
purview of each business unit, and our efforts to improve our
business portfolio have evolved to be sustainable. On the other hand,

<a id='baffca5d-668d-4dc7-ad31-3e8827e23d28'></a>

although ROIC functions as an indicator used for discussions, we have
not made it a uniform KPI because the risks and stages of each
business area are different. We are currently asking each business
for clear improvements to ROIC but so far we are still making
incremental improvements each year, leading us to believe there is
ample room for further improvement.

<a id='e6f3c2c8-580c-4007-9b78-4fb1d1afd997'></a>

Careful Selection of Investment Projects

We are also making advances in the careful selection of new investments. First, we are very mindful of strategy—that is, whether the investment fits our "Create, Grow, Extend" business model. In addition, although the hurdle rate should be raised in light of factors such as rising interest rates, appropriate judgment is needed for each individual investment, taking into account the fact that the uncertainty of preconditions varies depending on the case. The leadership team, which includes officers in charge of multiple business units, is unified in its involvement in the process of carefully selecting high-quality projects, including discussions on prioritizing the investment pipeline from a company-wide perspective. In addition, our External Directors have diverse experience and expertise, and they have numerous opportunities to point out sustainability issues in areas such as decarbonization and health, safety and environment (HSE), as well as the long-term sustainability of products and technologies, further raising the bar in our careful selection of new investments. The elevated focus on the business portfolio in each business unit, the leadership team's company-wide perspective, and the expertise and experience of our External Directors are all organically linked, leading me to believe that our business portfolio will be further enhanced, and our earnings power further increased going forward.

<a id='d9e2ecd4-92c7-429c-a466-fa7e2387bf3a'></a>

**To Our Shareholders and Investors**
Mitsui conducted a 2-for-1 share split with a record date of June 30,
2024. By lowering the stock price per investment unit of common
stock, we aim to make investing more accessible for our shareholders
and investors, as well as to enable greater liquidity in our stock and
further expansion of our investor base.

<a id='7306dc1b-31b8-4c17-ba88-fd3d9d83cac5'></a>

Looking back over the previous MTMP and the first year of the current MTMP, I can see that it has been a period when favorable conditions in the operating environment supported growth opportunities. Our financial results improved as the operating environment improved during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In this operating environment, we enhanced the earnings resilience of our entire business while also strengthening our business foundation to ensure that we can securely capture the upside arising from favorable conditions. We were able to conduct the reforms required for this purpose without any delays, while maintaining an overall balance. Looking at Mitsui's operating environment, there continues to be a strong necessity to respond to geopolitical risk, tackle sustainability, and increase the sophistication of and build redundancy into our supply chains, and my view is that there will be an increasing number of situations around the world where Mitsui will be called on to demonstrate its capabilities.

<a id='ff4f9773-5b48-4070-bd0d-1888ad002853'></a>

We will establish a positive cycle of implementing investments for growth that generate cash and profit, accumulating returns, and then allocating a certain amount of those returns to shareholders while keeping in mind sustainable improvement in ROE. We will continue to create value in a way unique to Mitsui by providing cross-industry _real solutions_ to social issues globally and across a wide range of industries. I hope to continue communicating Mitsui's ongoing growth story, the appeal and potential of our business, and our performance in a way that is easy for all of you to understand.

Enhancement of
Shareholder Returns

Mitsui has been enhancing shareholder returns based on cash flow generation, which has been strengthened through improvement in the quality of the business portfolio. Under Medium-term Management Plan 2026 (MTMP2026), we have introduced a progressive dividend, targeting shareholder returns of around 37% of cumulative Core Operating Cash Flow over the three-year period. However, based on the total payout forecast at the time the FY March 2025 Business Plan was announced, shareholder returns are expected to exceed 40%.

Progress of Medium-term Management Plan: (2) Cash Flow Allocation Forecast
Due to increases in Core Operating Cash Flow and asset recycling, cumulative cash inflow during MTMP2026 is expected to grow to approximately
4.2 trillion yen, and the Management Allocation is expected to expand from 1.13 trillion yen as of the announcement of MTMP2026 to 1.75 trillion yen.
From the expanded Management Allocation, we expect to allocate 770 billion yen to investments, increasing investments for growth over the three-year
period of the plan to 1.8 trillion yen. We will also allocate 420 billion yen to shareholder returns, continuing to increase both investments for growth and
shareholder returns.

The chart displays two metrics over fiscal years 2014 to 2026 (ending March): Core Operating Cash Flow per Share (left axis, JPY/share, represented by blue bars) and Share Repurchases (Cumulative) (right axis, Bn JPY, represented by a gray line with circles). The left Y-axis ranges from 0 to 400 JPY/share, and the right Y-axis ranges from 0 to 1,000 Bn JPY. Below the X-axis, the fiscal years are grouped by strategic periods: 'Challenge & Innovation for 2020' (2014-2017), 'Driving Value Creation' (2018-2020), 'Medium-term Management Plan 2023 Transform and Grow' (2021-2023), and 'Medium-term Management Plan 2026 Creating Sustainable Futures' (2024-2026). The average Core Operating Cash Flow per Share is highlighted for these periods: JPY 178/share for 2014-2020, JPY 314/share for 2021-2023, and Approx. JPY 355/share *1,2 for 2024-2026.

# Key Indicators of Financial StrategyMitsui allocates capital based on its cash flow allocation framework. This framework will help drive the implementation of a growth strategy that is compatible with maintaining and strengthening our financial position, through the balanced allocation of cash (from Core Operating Cash Flow and asset sales) to both sustain businesses and fund investments for growth, and shareholder returns. Our policy is to maintain appropriate levels for the below key indicators we focus on when considering our financial strategy, based on our cash flow allocation framework.

<a id='79f84267-0f25-4902-8b4e-4f6a7e6237b4'></a>

When we look at the balance between our non-current assets, which are relatively high risk, and equity that ultimately must be able to absorb the effects of this risk, we see the balance has gradually improved.

<a id='12d61c7d-6218-4800-ae6a-24fdb8b139cd'></a>

The difference between non-current assets and equity is mainly financed through interest-bearing debt, and if this expands, it reduces overall financial stability.

<a id='6ea3b93d-921c-4d3c-afb4-85838cfb884d'></a>

We secure financing mainly through long-term loans of around ten years. At the same time, we aim to reduce refinancing risk by avoiding long-term loans repayment being concentrated in any specific financial year.

<a id='886e73c6-1030-43fc-aa2c-94bc4d52f432'></a>

As a result, as of end-March 2024, interest-bearing debt to be repaid within one year accounted for approximately 21% of total interest-bearing debt, and the percentage due after more than five years was approximately 41%. For debt due after more than 5 years, we have issued 20-year corporate bonds and arranged other forms of interest-bearing debt with repayment periods extending as far as 2045,* with the intention of structuring a long maturity ladder.

<a id='b3a70ab6-29e5-48c0-9084-b260eed43745'></a>

Furthermore, we hold sufficient cash and
deposits to repay all interest-bearing debt
due within one year, and have secured
commitment lines that enable flexible access
to funds.

# Risk Management

We look laterally across the Company to identify material risks and implement appropriate risk control measures. The Chief Operating Officer of each business unit and overseas regional business unit is responsible for managing risks in their business domain within the authority delegated to them as part of the execution of their duties. Meanwhile, each of the Corporate Staff Divisions provides support to business units and overseas regional business units regarding the aspects of risk management that they are responsible for, while also monitoring the company-wide position and reporting to management. In addition, the major committees develop and maintain risk management structures on a company-wide basis and handle material risks as advisory bodies and subordinate organizations

<a id='6f82e6de-c744-4107-a752-6757398ca3fe'></a>

to the Executive Committee. Mitsui has established an integrated risk management system that manages company-wide risks centrally through the Executive Committee and its advisory body, the Portfolio Management Committee. The Corporate Staff Divisions, which act as the secretariat, manage risks from a company-wide perspective. In coordination with related divisions, they identify material risks and take appropriate measures, considering the frequency of occurrence, expected scale of damage, and level of risk tolerance. In FY March 2024, these efforts were discussed by the Portfolio Management Committee and then presented to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.

<::Mitsui Risk Management Structure: flowchart::>

The Mitsui Risk Management Structure diagram illustrates a comprehensive framework for managing financial and non-financial risks across different organizational units.

**Top-level Organizational Units:**
*   **Business Units and Overseas Regional Business Units**
*   **Corporate Staff Divisions**
*   **Integrated Risk Management Secretariat**

**Risk Types and Responsibilities:**

**1. Financial Risk (quantitative risk)**
*   **Business Units and Overseas Regional Business Units:** Control at each business site
*   **Corporate Staff Divisions:** Control the impact on shareholder equity

**2. Non-financial Risk (qualitative risk)**
*   **Business Units and Overseas Regional Business Units:**
    *   Strategy planning, policy formulation, and regulatory compliance
    *   Insurance coverage, etc.
*   **Corporate Staff Divisions:**
    *   Maintenance and periodic review of internal rules
    *   Insurance coverage, etc.

**Integrated Risk Management Secretariat:**
*   Identify and set countermeasures against material risks (Company-wide analysis)

**Central Risk Management Cycle:**
This cycle is common to all organizational units and involves four interconnected stages:
1.  **Understanding and identification**
2.  **Evaluation and countermeasures**
3.  **Policy formulation**
4.  **Execution**
Arrows indicate a continuous flow between these stages.

**Reporting and Decision-making Flow:**
1.  **Reporting** flows upwards to **Advisory committees and subordinate organizations to the Executive Committee** (refer to Page 47).
2.  **Advisory committees and subordinate organizations to the Executive Committee** feed into **Decision-making and approval**.
3.  **Decision-making and approval** leads to the **Executive Committee**.
4.  Feedback loops exist from the **Executive Committee** to **Decision-making and approval**, and from **Decision-making and approval** back to **Advisory committees and subordinate organizations to the Executive Committee**.
5.  There is also an upward arrow from **Advisory committees and subordinate organizations to the Executive Committee** to **Reporting**.

## Quantitative Analysis Using Risk Assets

As part of our integrated risk management, we conduct a quantitative risk analysis every year. The results are discussed by the Portfolio Management Committee as being "Mitsui's risk exposure and control," and then reported to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.

<a id='f602fdf0-4d3d-47dc-b21b-3d2f08f2f870'></a>

In addition to the total risk related to assets on the balance sheet, quantitative risk analysis is also used to assess off-balance sheet risks, such as market risk and guarantee liabilities, against defined criteria. Those that meet the criteria are designated as risk assets, and we regularly monitor the associated risk exposure. Risk assets are the basis on which integrated risk management is used to analyze the current situation from various perspectives, such as business investment risk, credit risk, and market risk, as well as by segment, country, and region. We have confirmed that risk assets have remained within the range of around 60-70% of shareholder equity over the past 10 years.

<a id='5a68109a-6165-4796-90ee-df9008dcc524'></a>

In addition to the ratio (level) of risk assets to shareholder equity, we calculate the ratio (level) of profit to risk assets. After FY March 2016, when we posted a loss, the ratio of profit to risk assets generally remained at around 15%, but fell to around 10% in FY March 2021, when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident. Thereafter, it exceeded 20% from FY March 2022 through FY March 2024.

<a id='61aa3886-4e15-4bd3-bfeb-a5d6d9fc782b'></a>

Moreover, we have conducted various stress tests such as for a downgrade in the internal ratings of our assets and sudden fluctuations in foreign exchange and stock markets, and examined the impact on risk exposure and its ratio (level) to shareholder equity.

<a id='d7a3a84f-9e8d-4dd6-90fb-74b013c313c8'></a>

Core Operating Cash Flow has been at the 1 trillion yen level for three consecutive fiscal years. One mechanism underpinning this performance is our advanced risk management. We will continue to conduct appropriate risk management to be ready for downside risks to our financial performance. Doing so will in turn lead to the enhancement of our corporate value.

<a id='9d9bb1a5-0224-4934-bb0d-415e1b8da644'></a>

In FY March 2024, we identified risk regarding human capital limitation risks and human rights risks as new material risks.

<a id='a166bdaa-730b-411c-b64e-4f58be699d59'></a>

We identified these risks due to changes in the external environment where
there is an increased level of interest in sustainability initiatives in areas including
human capital, human rights, and supply chains, as well as the increase in affiliated
companies that recognize these risks as material risks through their Control
Self-Assessment (CSA), which was introduced in FY March 2023.

<a id='c01c427c-08b8-4349-af44-6e40905b1fa5'></a>

Human capital limitation risks are associated with the loss of opportunities to create business value and the impairment of stable operations in the event

<a id='9609666d-e09c-483b-b9dc-1cbeb756ea51'></a>

of a shortage of human resources. To mitigate this risk, we are conducting human resources management, including securing, developing, evaluating, and remunerating our people appropriately to secure the human capital we need.

<a id='9cd3dddc-d9f5-47fa-ba06-27e40998a076'></a>

Human rights risks are associated with reputational damage due to human rights violations arising from our activities and business relationships within the supply chain and elsewhere, as well as the risk of incurring additional costs associated with eliminating or mitigating the impact of such damage. In addition to reducing risk through human rights due diligence, we take appropriate steps to correct and remedy issues when they arise.

What are your views on the link between the Company's human resources strategy and corporate value enhancement?

<a id='18018a94-f14a-4cb4-9711-f41cf4f5db68'></a>

Our human resources strategy exists to achieve the Company's management goals, so the linkage is crucial. The key to advancing our "create, grow, extend" business model always lies in our people. Through the steady implementation of our human resources strategy, we aim for diverse individuals who share the same aspiration and passion to form agile teams in and out of Japan, addressing social issues and fostering innovation through cross-industry initiatives.

<a id='00e50148-02d2-489d-880f-2e67dd40f083'></a>

## Could you tell us about the Mitsui Engagement Survey (MES)?

MES, introduced in 2018 as a metric to measure the effectiveness of our human resources strategy, is now conducted across all offices outside Japan and major subsidiaries both in and out of Japan. This survey, from the perspective of each individual employee, measures and analyzes attachment to the workplace, motivation, feeling of personal growth, and empathy towards the organization's strategy and directions. The results are used to encourage improvement actions. To ensure the objectivity and transparency of the survey, we have partnered with an external research firm and customized the survey methodology to fit Mitsui's characteristics. Given the significant correlation observed between MES results and organizational productivity and performance, the results are reported to the Board of Directors as one of our key management indicators and are also utilized as a KPI for remuneration of Directors. 73% of the responses in the "employee engagement" score in last year's MES were positive, which was an improvement from the previous year, and provided various

<a id='e00085ce-ca6b-4bbf-9cc8-20b88a00028a'></a>

insights for addressing organizational issues.

<a id='596973fe-beb0-49c4-aa28-0977953b213e'></a>

Regarding diversity, we achieved our goal of increasing the
percentage of female managers to 10% this year and have set a
new target of 20% by FY March 2031. Considering that the percentage
of female managers at our overseas trading affiliates is approximately
40%, challenges are with the situation in Japan, while we aim to
realize our corporate philosophy of "Thrive on diversity" not just
by achieving such numerical goals but by improving MES results
at the same time. By the end of this year, our global talent
management system "Bloom" will be fully operational for 9,000
employees. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of various human
resources measures based on data and leverage this to drive
Mitsui's further growth.

<a id='febb3a7c-e790-4edf-aff7-3d0900192b73'></a>

Can you provide examples of how your human resources strategy has led to new value creation?

<a id='822948bc-85dd-4c71-b315-bfc8da35cf4e'></a>

Our participation in the ADNOC LNG Project in the Middle East is expected not only to serve as a foundation for stable energy supply but also to demonstrate the value of our diverse talent working shoulder to shoulder across different business units. Their efforts went beyond infrastructure development in resource-rich countries to include the promotion of new industries and market development, which has been recognized by our partners.

<a id='aa735424-27c4-46b5-9222-34ed2aa1ddcc'></a>

Our current earnings base is the result of promoting both
growth and human resources strategies. Moving forward, we will
continue to enhance an open environment in which as many
individuals as possible embodying Mitsui's growth can be
nurtured, and diverse talent can fully realize their capabilities.

Accelerating our transformation with digital using generative Al to
further improve performance and create new businesses

<a id='0fe25833-0baa-4f6a-b4bc-a528343d8a93'></a>

## How are Mitsui's digital initiatives progressing?

Broadly speaking, the Mitsui & Co. Group is pushing ahead with two transformations with digital (DX). The first is to improve performance through DX to enable our people to do a bigger job, and the second is to create new businesses using digital technology and AI. We have been fully committed to DX since 2017. Based on the accumulation of DX projects and our steady progress in establishing a DX platform and developing DX talent, I feel that we have built a solid foundation and wish to make a big leap this fiscal year, including the full-fledged utilization of generative AI.

<a id='0488e20e-82a1-4d9f-88b2-3818bc089f21'></a>

## Please introduce some of your main DX projects.

We have already started implementation of more than 50 DX projects. I would like to introduce a notable one, ALTERNA from Mitsui & Co. Digital Asset Management. ALTERNA is an online asset management service that enables digital securitization of assets such as real estate and infrastructure, allowing retail investors to invest in small amounts. With the issuance of security tokens,* permitted by a change in Japanese law in 2020, digital technology can now be used to reduce transaction costs and conduct smaller transactions, making it possible for individuals to invest in real estate and infrastructure assets, which were previously markets mainly for institutional investors.

<a id='48d2eeee-ace7-48fc-b944-3548380927f5'></a>

**Can you tell us about the DX platform that will support DX projects?**

We have formulated the Digital Grand Design as a compass for digital governance and standardization of our DX platform. We aim to move away from individual optimization based on building systems according to business needs. Instead, by optimizing systems, processes, and data based on the Digital Grand Design, we aim to improve performance throughout the entire Group and enable swift and accurate decision-making.

<a id='f7b7f9de-2acb-4d78-a77e-f7d3f74edc25'></a>

### How are you developing personnel to drive DX initiatives?

We aim to equip our diverse personnel, who are well-versed in a wide range of businesses, with digital skills to make all staff DX-ready. We have also upgraded our in-house certification system to encourage employees to drive business transformation through DX by utilizing the digital knowledge they have acquired at the Mitsui DX Academy, which was launched in 2021. Our focus for this fiscal year is on learning about generative AI and its application.

<a id='2edf6064-3b9e-402b-ae90-a7333ab74d4d'></a>

**Some have called 2023 "year one of generative AI."**
**How is the Company approaching generative AI?**

---

We launched "MBK Private AI," which is an internal application for generative AI, in March 2023. Generative AI has the potential to significantly expand what is possible for humans. So to allow our personnel to utilize generative AI toward their further success, we are working on familiarization across the Group, and are advancing preparatory work such as the setting up of governance measures. I use generative AI as my "good partner" in preparing for various meetings and other situations. Based on my first-hand experience of the improvement in performance, I am committed to encouraging its utilization.

<a id='18d458f7-3298-45fd-ab1a-e708962a7e3b'></a>

What are your initiatives and expectations for this fiscal year?
---
We will leverage AI in both internal and external business activities
to make further improvements in performance and create new
businesses. By utilizing AI, we intend to take the first step in building
a new future for Mitsui at an unprecedented speed and creativity.
"Mitsui & Co. × AI = ∞ (infinite) possibilities."

# Mitsui's DX
Digital Transformation and Innovation with Digital

<a id='cc6adc9a-f2e0-45f3-addb-c6edf4ee3198'></a>

We have a broad range of frontline assets where we can acquire valuable data based on actual experience. Mitsui's digital transformation (DX) applies the power of digital technology to these important frontlines; which means aiming to reduce costs and expand sales through efficiency improvement and optimization, and create new business models by multiplying Operational Technology* with Digital Power.

* OT (Operational Technology): Any operational expertise of an investment and trading company, including product knowledge, business expertise, marketing skills, trading functions, legal matters, human resources, project management, etc.

<a id='bf8af639-87bc-455e-9cc0-7c44a0ac328f'></a>

## DX Business

Based on the DX Comprehensive Strategy, numerous digital transformation projects have been created since the establishment of the Integrated Digital Strategy Division.

### Number of DX Projects as of March 31, 2024

As of March 2024, a cumulative total of more than 400 DX projects have undergone consideration, of which more than 100 were trialed or began system development, and more than 50 were implemented or are in actual operation, indicating the steady progress we have made.

ALTERNA

Mitsui & Co. Digital Asset Management (MDM) was established with the aim of popularizing alternative investments, driven by a change in Japanese law to allow the issuance of security tokens. In 2023, MDM launched ALTERNA, a service that enables individuals to invest easily via their smartphones in real-world assets such as real estate and infrastructure, a market that was previously only accessible to professional institutional investors.

<a id='18d24c95-c93b-4b63-84be-592cee3a13a1'></a>

Characteristics of Our Governance Structure

<a id='42d290e7-ca51-4358-89db-35a557983cb7'></a>

**Takano** First, please tell us about the characteristics of Mitsui's governance structure.

<a id='dd82be8f-5dd1-4ea9-a8a3-8cc40dc8b23c'></a>

Egawa I believe Mitsui's Board of Directors has four characteristics. The first is that, as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, the Board of Directors is responsible for both important decision-making and oversight. Executive Committee members participate in discussions either as Internal Directors or observers, leading to substantive decision-making based on internal insights. Also, all of our decisions are made based on unanimous approval. The second point is the presence of Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Audit & Supervisory Board Members at Japanese companies are polarized into those who actively express their opinions and those who restrain their opinions. At Mitsui, Audit & Supervisory Board Members actively participate in discussions, enhancing the validity of decision-making. The third point is that decisions are made based on free and open-minded discussions, and management highly value the opinions of External Directors. The fourth point is that our External Directors are a highly diverse group of professionals, improving the quality of decision-making.

<a id='76bbd6d3-0701-4dbe-9c43-560d319813ab'></a>

The diversity of the board is an important element that investors and other stakeholders pay close attention to. When appointing non-Japanese as directors, many Japanese companies choose those living in Japan. However, it is important that the Company went through various considerations before arriving at the current board composition in order to achieve true diversity of the Board of Directors.

<a id='76a30273-96a5-4f09-b032-e72feb3d7826'></a>

**Yasunaga** Non-Japanese living in Japan are well-versed in Japanese culture and therefore discussions may go rather smoothly. However, such discussions based on shared tacit understanding sometimes

do not contribute to diversity in the true sense. People who are not familiar with Japanese culture often provide stimulating inputs and unexpected insights, and I believe that is the real value of diversity.

<a id='56d97d73-b083-4a20-abb6-986ff91a331c'></a>

At Mitsui, engaging in global and cross-industry businesses,
we are always wary that discussions based only on Japanese values
could lead to future risks and missed opportunities. As such,
welcoming non-Japanese with diverse values and expertise,
those who have headed non-Japanese companies, or those who
have led Japanese subsidiaries of non-Japanese companies, is a
minimum requirement for Mitsui to be a global company.

<a id='a4f14255-d031-4119-8b4a-890858775252'></a>

Egawa I totally agree. By having such diverse people on the Board,
we can gain industry-specific expertise. It is also beneficial because
they are familiar with the governance practices of companies outside
Japan. For instance, we can hear opinions regarding the relationship
between External Directors and executive management based on
various examples.

<a id='431ea0c1-db68-49ec-974d-689f0d80c6b1'></a>

**Takano** How do you evaluate voluntarily established committees at Mitsui, especially the Governance Committee?

<a id='6ca492ea-ff8e-4189-a3f3-c6793f45b2bc'></a>

**Egawa** Establishing the Governance, Nomination, and Remuneration Committees in 2004 was a progressive move at the time, and even now, few companies have a governance committee. Normally, the board of directors would discuss effectiveness of the board and institutional design, but having a governance committee allows more focused discussions on those issues. We have established the Governance Committee precisely because we recognize the importance of those discussions, and I believe its significance is understood by external stakeholders as well.

<a id='476d8d5f-b904-4104-9ca7-0ad6da5e0eb7'></a>

# Changes to the Governance Structure

**Takano** Regarding the recent changes made to Mitsui's governance structure, while the current organizational design of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board remains unchanged, the number of Internal Directors was reduced from nine to six, which makes the ratio of External to Internal Directors equal at 6:6. The executive structure was also revised, which includes reaffirming the role of the Executive Committee members as the leadership team and establishing the position of General Counsel. Ms. Egawa, how do you evaluate this change?

<a id='329a5481-e1b8-4799-bfa8-e898ab635111'></a>

**Egawa** I think it is a good change. Previously, the number of Directors was large and the ratio of Internal Directors was somewhat high, but we resolved those issues. In terms of the structure, we have now clearly distinguished between Directors, who are responsible for oversight, and the leadership team, with only Chief Officers of the leadership team becoming members of the Board of Directors. This has clarified the division of roles. Furthermore, although some of the officers in charge of business units are no longer Directors, they continue to attend Board meetings as observers, and this has resulted in a good structure that aligns with our strengths.

<a id='8083c676-d38a-4d28-bd98-19b37042cac3'></a>

**Yasunaga** Looking back, when I became CEO in 2015, there were five External Directors, but we had more members with backgrounds in the public sector and academia rather than those with corporate management experience. Back then, we used to discuss issues from a company-wide perspective at Corporate Management Committee (currently the Executive Committee) meetings and strived to include the insights of External Directors at Board meetings, but I felt the need for even more diverse members on the Board to reflect more global views and broader corporate management insights.

<a id='6d9f6f8e-5c8f-42fc-8f0d-40bf4572d24f'></a>

To discuss the overall management of the Company, it is necessary for the Board to deeply understand how our approach to HR and organizational management, as well as regional and business axes function, how we have reached the current earnings structure, and how all of these will lead to future developments for our business, through discussions on individual projects. Accordingly, we thought we should not compromise on ensuring the diversity of Directors' backgrounds, and made gradual changes to the composition of the Board of Directors. The current six External Directors are truly diverse in terms of nationality, gender, careers, and views. I believe that the current Board formation is in many ways an ideal one. The Board is capable of not only deliberating each investment, but also engaging in more profound discussions, while considering the background to each investment.

<a id='fc101ae5-708a-4fa2-9f5d-d914b732ef7b'></a>

At that point I thought the Board moved closer to its ideal form,
but it has been pointed out that Board meetings need to be more
interactive and that discussions sometimes had become like Q&A
sessions between Internal and External Directors. It had also been
suggested that the Board should not just deliberate on individual
investments but should also delve deeper into more overarching,
important matters that could define the Company's future, which I
thought was indeed a valid point.

<a id='d5997f52-95ff-4cae-9269-729e2e201aa9'></a>

Currently, the Board of Directors actively discusses various themes from a higher perspective, such as how the Company can allocate its resources in order to sustainably grow in the future and position itself to contribute to society.

<a id='c95058c3-8264-481f-97c3-a508ba2157bb'></a>

Egawa Thanks to your explanation, I now understand the transition of Mitsui's Board of Directors.

In recent years, many Japanese companies have raised the ratio of external directors, so I thought it would be good for Mitsui to slightly increase that ratio as well. Upon official approval at the most recent General Meeting of Shareholders, the ratio of External Directors reached 50%.

<a id='3306ec9e-010b-461a-bf1c-b886a2f843d2'></a>

Takano Was there any particular discussion that impressed you?

<a id='5ba04aee-c4ef-4e1a-84d9-17aa8a0b714a'></a>

Egawa What impressed me most was the positioning of Internal Directors. It was what we spent the most time discussing, and I believe it was essentially one of the most important topics. To thoroughly deliberate individual investments within the Board, the insights of Internal Directors are indispensable, and there were also concerns whether engaging with external parties without the director title could be disadvantageous. I imagine that there were extended discussions within the Company, encompassing more than what we discussed in Board meetings or Governance Committee meetings. After considering those concerns and factors, we were able to organize the Board of Directors as a supervisory function with officers with CXO titles joining the Board, while the leadership team, as members of the Executive Committee, will emphasize its significance externally. As a result, the division of roles between oversight and execution became even clearer, and I believe that the increase in the ratio of External Directors has led to stronger oversight.

<a id='52f2c907-ed0f-4cea-a193-c21454833cce'></a>

**Yasunaga** The Governance Committee discussed from scratch what governance should look like in its ideal form. We asked ourselves whether the authority of the officers in charge of business units would be reduced if they were no longer Directors, or whether it simply represents the changes in their expected roles. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that, by highlighting their roles as members of the Executive Committee—the leadership team—and by clearly contrasting the different roles played by the director and the executive side, we can ensure that they will function effectively under the new governance structure.

<a id='25e7e4aa-f1b8-42c4-8cb3-571ebf46842d'></a>

After extensive and detailed discussions and referring to the
board composition of companies outside Japan, we ultimately
made a decision on the current structure. At companies outside Japan,
in terms of board members from the executive side, often, it is the
CEO only, or the CEO and CFO at most, while the rest are external

<a id='83f416f0-0e50-4df2-b685-db98b066d51c'></a>

directors, and business execution is usually entrusted to the leadership team, such as the management committee or other forms of the executive decision-making body. Telling people from outside Japan that this restructuring has brought us up to international standards, the response is that there are still too many internal directors. On the other hand, the perception in Japan is that we are quite progressive.

<a id='d59c227a-196d-4bb4-9d4c-c78f76235338'></a>

We have communicated to the officers in charge of business units that not only will their authority be maintained, but more of a company-wide perspective will be required going forward. We also emphasize within the Company that this change has set us on the path to becoming an even more genuinely global company.

<a id='583205fa-ba4d-487a-a678-e63779ef1d6f'></a>

Furthermore, since we have such a diverse group of six External Directors, we thought it would be better to increase the role expectations and responsibilities of the External Directors, not as six out of 15, but as six out of 12. In that sense as well, each of the 12 members feels the weight of their respective opinions in steering the Company.

Recent Changes to Board Meetings

<a id='91eb7682-1543-4b83-9972-31de8716a82b'></a>

**Takano** Over the past few years, we have taken various steps to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors through changes to the way meetings are operated. For example, we have revised the criteria for matters to be resolved and introduced more thorough pre-meeting briefings for External Directors and External Members meetings. Other changes include providing more detailed information to External Directors. Ms. Egawa, what has been your impression of these initiatives?

<a id='f9e7998b-632d-4158-bb46-5681808e3028'></a>

**Egawa** The Company has been working for some time to revise its criteria for matters to be resolved by the Board of Directors so that the Board could focus on a smaller number of substantial items. In parallel with these efforts, we also discussed a reduction in the frequency of Board meetings. Board members residing outside Japan were especially vocal about that change. In fact, many non-Japanese companies have fewer board meetings and allocate more time to each meeting.

<a id='8f5dd5fa-33cc-45d8-b170-083f24dba75e'></a>

According to a survey that I referenced previously, American

<a id='317b22a2-a751-40d2-a411-9e69ef1635e6'></a>

companies hold a total of five to nine board meetings per year, including four to five face-to-face meetings and one to four telephone meetings. The average duration of meetings was over five hours for face-to-face meetings and one hour for telephone meetings. My impression is that Mitsui's practice is getting closer to those of overseas companies. Having reduced the frequency of meetings, we now use online meetings and written resolutions for urgent matters. Meanwhile, for our face-to-face meetings, we spend greater time on more substantive discussions. In addition to thorough pre-meeting briefings, we also hold free discussion sessions and the External Members Meeting before and after Board meetings. By combining sessions such as these, we have, in effect, increased the amount of discussion. The pre-meeting briefings also include explanations and discussions about investments that are strategically important but not included in the agenda for Board meetings.

<a id='cd4ed788-486f-4c8f-8b05-52b57de490ea'></a>

Yasunaga I also felt that we were holding too many Board meetings. However, when discussing investments, we also need to align our schedules with those of other parties, including our business partners and host countries. In some cases, it is too late if we only deliberate

on investments once every three months. That is why we needed to
hold meetings often enough to align with the speed of deal making.
Under these circumstances, we have to adjust our approaches, such
as discussing individual investments well in advance where possible
or deliberating via online meetings. That said, some members have
commented that it is difficult to discuss important projects online.
So, while recognizing the need for in-person meetings, an ongoing
issue for us is how to effectively modify the way in which meetings
are conducted.

<a id='9677f3ef-81fa-4190-8b36-efca1f00df8f'></a>

Takano What are your thoughts concerning changes in the themes
discussed at Board meetings?

<a id='cc467200-c819-4ab5-a819-127532443401'></a>

Egawa I see a number of significant changes. For example, in response to requests from External Directors, we now have more discussions on portfolio reviews and sustainability-related issues. In particular, we now engage in more thorough discussions about HSE (health, safety and environment) reports, especially safety.

<a id='fefe373e-f039-48df-a071-8d227f2221c4'></a>

<a id='f5c7416b-04b4-47ce-b78e-a651715b9c6d'></a>

**Takano** I served as a member of the Board of Directors Secretariat until last year. Based on the comments from External Directors that the Board should be discussing broader and more strategic matters, we increased the opportunities for the Board to deliberate on important management matters. We also strived to thoroughly explain the positioning of individual investments in the context of overall strategies as we discussed them.

<a id='e5c6c930-ca9f-4e4c-832e-7cf70cbde6c1'></a>

Egawa I also find it extremely useful to be briefed on the strategies and activities of each business unit at the External Members Meeting and other meetings. While deliberations about individual investments will deepen our understanding about business units engaged in large-scale investment and financing projects, we tend to have few opportunities to get to know other business units. This issue is now covered through setting the agenda items for Board meetings or External Members Meetings.

<a id='4a7d7720-c581-4e8e-8698-ebc55e4b8a40'></a>

Aiming for Further Improvements
to Governance

<a id='655d6abb-ee56-42b3-b04b-eed461d5a432'></a>

**Takano** What kind of improvements do you think we need in order to further enhance governance?

<a id='1cdf47cd-d629-4765-9afa-6e827892f582'></a>

**Egawa** I believe that the Board of Directors needs to debate strategies from a company-wide perspective and continually work to deepen portfolio reviews with an emphasis on ROIC. I also think that from the perspective of maintaining discipline, it would be useful to decide in advance at the time of final investment decisions (FIDs) of large-scale investments that the investment will be reviewed in, for example, two to three years. As already commented in Governance Committee meetings and during effectiveness evaluations of the Board, I think that there should be regular opportunities for discussion sessions among just the External Directors and External Audit & Supervisory Board Members.

<a id='a4514c8a-1d4d-4cb1-b797-0cd9b46d500b'></a>

**Yasunaga** I would like External Directors to continue holding these sessions and highlight aspects that may not be apparent to those of us within the Company.

<a id='daa95f28-d0b0-4685-a33e-175251fccaf3'></a>

Meanwhile, our frontline staff continuously apply PDCA cycles to projects, while both the Portfolio Management Committee and the Executive Committee monitor progress on the middle game* for every investment. If all of this information were reported to the Board of Directors, there would be too much to report, and the Board would not be able to function effectively. The Board therefore needs to focus mainly on new projects and projects with issues. We also need to ensure that PDCA cycles are applied efficiently. For example, there are projects with issues for which reports are submitted on a weekly basis, so the executive side may need to reconsider how internal reporting should be made in order to improve efficiency. On a different note, I think paying visits to frontline operations is the best way for External Directors to learn about our frontline efforts to create value and enhance return on investment. This year, for example, External Directors were invited to visit some of our frontline operations in North America, and we would like to arrange more visits to provide opportunities to observe our frontline operations in each region.

<a id='91602597-704e-4026-97bb-f39a0554346c'></a>

* The intermediate stages between the entry and exit points of investments, where the focus is on enhancing individual businesses and implementing turnarounds to improve earnings power.

<a id='b474929e-2fa4-44b4-a4e9-e06809e7670c'></a>

Takano Finally, as Chair of the Board, what is your vision for the future of the Board of Directors in light of the recent changes in the governance structure?

<a id='4e28aa4b-8d7b-440e-9e57-5570c9b927e5'></a>

**Yasunaga** I would like to take a natural approach. Despite changes in the number of Directors and the composition of the Board of Directors, we will continue to prioritize our goal of achieving unanimity. Diversity is meaningless if opposing views are suppressed through majority decision-making. For us to sustainably grow while embracing diversity, unanimous decision-making by a diverse Board of Directors is essential. If we were unable to reach unanimous decisions, that would indicate that certain problems do exist. I therefore do not intend to change our basic commitment to making unanimous decisions. In my view, even if a deadline is looming and we do not have much time left, we need to debate issues fully and explore a conclusion that satisfies all members. This is the greatest value of our diverse Board of Directors. To continue providing this value, we will strive to have more interactive discussions and deepen our mutual understanding toward further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.

Changes to Governance and Executive Structures

<a id='c42383db-798e-47ae-8d20-e655b703cc61'></a>

**Changes to the Board of Directors**
In order to facilitate management oversight and establish a balance of personnel that enables the Board of Directors to engage in deeper and more effective deliberations, the number of Internal Directors was reduced from nine to six following the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 19, 2024, resulting in a total of 12 Directors (with an equal number of External Directors and Internal Directors).

<a id='64270fee-50a1-4809-8d9f-3dc02fa9711f'></a>

Members of the Board of Directors <::visual content: The visual shows a breakdown of the Board of Directors and Observers. The Board of Directors totals 12 members. This is split into two categories: External: 6 (represented by 6 dark blue human icons) and Internal: 6 (represented by 6 light blue human icons). The internal members are further labeled as: Chair, CEO, CHRO/CCO, CFO, CSO, and CDIO. Below the Board of Directors, connected by a line with a plus sign, are Observers: 4. These observers are represented by 4 outlined human icons. Three of these observers are labeled as "In charge of business units", and one is labeled as "GC".: figure::>

## Changes to Executive Structure
Effective April 1, 2024, we newly established the position of General Counsel, who serves as a member of the Executive Committee (the Corporate Management Committee prior to this date).
For a more agile response to an increasingly complex business environment and related risks, and to ensure the steady realization of our management strategies, we have reaffirmed the role of the Executive Committee as our management leadership team with the aim of further enhancing corporate value. The committee consists of the Chair of the Board of Directors, the President and CEO (the committee chair), the officers in charge of Corporate Staff Divisions, and Representative Directors or Managing Officers nominated by the President and CEO. The Executive Committee meets weekly, in principle. Matters referred to the Executive Committee are determined by the President and CEO, taking into consideration discussions among the committee members.

Corporate Governance Structure

<a id='acf3b011-0714-4405-a7d9-b8c1c4d859da'></a>

• **Improving Transparency and Accountability**
The Company ensures sound oversight and monitoring of management by taking into account the viewpoints of External Directors and External Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Company has also established an internal control system for disclosure to ensure that all managerial personnel and employees fulfill their accountability under the principle of fair disclosure.

<a id='120c82ec-c786-4d7f-a165-5324909851ea'></a>

*   **Clarifying the Separation of Management Oversight and Execution Roles**
The Company substantially delegates execution of business to Managing Officers while the Board of Directors oversees the business activities of Managing Officers. The Chief Operating Officers of 16 business units, which carry out global business activities for each business, and two overseas regional business units, which are the backbone of our regional strategies, serve as Managing Officers and Regional Officers, respectively, and engage in business operations for the Group in a responsive and flexible manner.

<a id='fa3eab91-57fd-471a-afbe-aa1d2229ed3f'></a>

The Company works to enhance the effectiveness of the audit function of Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Furthermore, it has determined that management aligned with the actual state of each business, centering on Internal Directors who are deeply familiar with Company operations and have a high level of expertise, is essential given its business model as a global investment and trading company. In addition to implementing appropriate corporate governance as a company with an audit and supervisory board, the Company has established various advisory committees, in which the majority of members are External Directors or External Audit & Supervisory Board Members. This structure improves transparency and accountability, and clarifies separation between management oversight and execution roles, thereby achieving highly effective corporate governance.

Framework for Internal Control and Execution of Business Activities
Ultimate responsibility for the execution of business operations lies with the President and CEO. The President and CEO delegates authority to the Chief Operating Officers of business units and overseas regional business units, who, in turn, report to the President and CEO. The Executive Committee is organized for deliberating on basic policies and important matters relating to overall management.

<a id='14a0ffc9-5f72-4c45-acb7-7d430d9056eb'></a>

Based on the basic design of internal controls provided by the Board of Directors, management assumes the role and responsibility of maintaining, operating, and assessing internal controls. The Internal Auditing Division, which is positioned directly under the President and CEO, assumes the role and responsibility of independently verifying the conformance of the design and the implementation of internal controls, based on the plan approved by management. Internal auditing activities are directly communicated on a regular basis to the Board of Directors and to the Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Company is also working to create an organization with integrity by establishing and strengthening a compliance framework on a global group basis.

## Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is the highest authority for the execution of business and oversight. In order to secure this function, the Company has maintained the number of Directors at a level that is suitable for having substantive discussions. The term of Directors is one year, and there is no prohibition on their reappointment.

<a id='1d27d95f-2bee-4c1d-84df-d4a3f101b9e1'></a>

The Board of Directors, in accordance with the internal regulations on matters to be resolved or reported at the meeting of the Board of Directors, resolves matters considering fundamental policies related to management, matters of important business operation, matters mandated by the General Meeting of Shareholders, and matters stipulated in laws and regulations and the Articles of Incorporation.

Nomination Committee Process for Nominating Directors and Managing Officers

The Nomination Committee, which is chaired by an External Director, formulates the policy for appointing Directors, including the CEO, and Managing Officers. In addition to using candidate data, which includes a multifaceted evaluation, in the nomination process, initiatives include setting up opportunities for the External Directors and External Audit & Supervisory Board Members who are members of the Nomination Committee to familiarize themselves with the unique attributes of candidates, including their personalities, abilities, and other characteristics. The Nomination Committee is also involved in selection of candidates for External Director from the early stage.

<a id='fd4a6a25-8d94-4d20-be55-a3b79c8a5614'></a>

After the Nomination Committee has confirmed that a candidate satisfies the requirements based on the appointment policy through the above process, the proposal for the appointment of a Director/Managing Officer is submitted to the Board of Directors.
In addition, the Company has positioned its CEO succession plan as one of its key management issues for enhancing the Group's corporate value and achieving sustainable growth over the medium to long term.

<a id='52456ea5-7ac5-4c7a-ab2c-5a2484c20659'></a>

**Highlight** **Providing Information to External Members**

For enhanced deliberations and more efficient management at Board of Directors meetings, we conduct briefings for External Members prior to Board meetings and provide opportunities for them to deepen their understanding of the business through advance distribution of agenda materials, as well as advance explanations and question-and-answer sessions from relevant divisions. Furthermore, even when a matter falls short of the criteria for resolution/reporting to the Board of Directors, important matters discussed at Executive Committee and other meetings are shared with External Members in a timely manner. This enhanced provision of information contributes to improved deliberations at Board of Directors meetings. A total of 10 External Members Meetings were held in FY March 2024, and measures to strengthen engagement were implemented, including exchanges of opinions among External Members based on information provided by Internal Directors on feedback on engagement with capital markets, climate change response, and Wellness Ecosystem Creation.

# Remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Company has established a policy for determining the remuneration of individual Directors by resolution of the Board of Directors, following deliberation by and reporting from the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by an External Director. The Remuneration Committee discusses the remuneration structure for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and examines the appropriateness of the levels and proportions of fixed remuneration, results-linked bonuses, and medium- to long-term incentive remuneration based on trends at other companies, and then reports this as well as the appropriateness of clawback provisions to the Board of Directors, among other measures, in order to ensure transparency in the determination of Directors' and Audit & Supervisory Board Members' remuneration. Regarding remuneration of individual Directors, after receiving the report of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors confirms and issues an opinion on whether the contents of the determined remuneration are consistent with the applicable policy.

• Mitsui and consolidated subsidiaries (including un-incorporated joint ventures) are calculated according to the financial control approach (as with Scope 1 and Scope 2).
• Where the same emissions source is clearly double-counted among the companies included in the scope of the data, only one is included in the calculation.
• In cases where the final product into which an intermediary product is processed cannot be determined, it is excluded from the calculation.
• Approx. 70% of total Scope 3 emissions (excluding Category 15) are derived from the trading of third-party products and approx. 30% from the production/manufacturing/processing of products at Mitsui.
• Trading of third-party products is defined as when Mitsui buys products produced/manufactured/processed by third parties to sell to processors, end-users, etc. It does not include transactions with "traders" where the processor or end-user cannot be determined.
• Category 1 and 11 energy-related emissions are calculated in line with the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) guidelines.
• For ferrous raw materials (iron ore and metallurgical coal), Category 10 emissions are calculated proportionally by weight based on emissions when used for the production of crude steel.
• Category 1, 10, and 11 segment breakdowns only include the relevant segments.

Changes in Earnings Structure

Alliances with partners at JA Mitsui Leasing, Mitsui Knowledge Industry, QVC Japan, and other core group companies in Japan, expansion of the business base through acquisitions, and improvements in efficiency through strategic allocation of management resources have contributed substantially to earnings growth. We have also achieved growth in the commodity derivatives trading and real estate businesses, where the human capital, know-how, and trust from the market that we have accumulated throughout our history have been the major strengths. In addition to reinforcing the earnings base of existing businesses and conducting bolt-on type investments, we will work to improve asset efficiency through securitization of owned assets and reconfiguring our portfolio.

## Editor's Afterword

In Integrated Report 2024, in its seventh edition, we have focused on clearly articulating our uniqueness. Through messages from the CEO and other members of management, Our Edge, the "Challenge and Innovation" case study, and other sections, we have highlighted the global scale of operations, the global and wide-ranging business portfolio, cross-industry initiatives, and various initiatives and mechanisms to achieve these. In addition, we have expanded disclosures on sustainability-related issues such as "Business and Human Rights, and Supply Chains" and "Natural Capital," and on governance-related issues, we have provided a detailed explanation of the changes to the governance structure implemented during this fiscal year in the roundtable discussion, thereby introducing our unique initiatives here as well. We have aimed to create a report rich in information by enhancing the information on business activities and sustainability to enable better understanding of Mitsui, while significantly reducing the number of pages compared to last year. We would appreciate your frank feedback upon reading this report.
