Our Financial Control Framework:
<::Our Financial Control Framework
: flowchart
Our Financial Control Framework is represented by a central blue square icon depicting a globe with a dollar sign and a stack of coins/documents, connected to six surrounding rectangular elements, each detailing a component of the framework.

**1. Documented Policies** (Icon: document with lines)
Standardised financial policies and procedures are consistently followed.

**2. Segregation of Duties** (Icon: two people icons, one with a warning triangle)
Roles for authorisation, asset custody, and record-keeping are clearly segregated to mitigate risks.

**3. IT Controls** (Icon: computer monitor with a lock)
Access rights, change management, and data backups safeguard financial systems.

**4. Management Oversight** (Icon: line graph with an eye icon)
Financial processes and control effectiveness are reviewed regularly by management.

**5. Reconciliations** (Icon: two linked circles with arrows, one containing a checkmark)
Regular reviews of key accounts (bank, receivables, payables, inventory) ensure timely identification of discrepancies.

**6. Authorisations and Approvals** (Icon: two linked circles with arrows, one containing a checkmark)
All key financial transactions require pre-approved authorisation levels.

**7. Internal and Customer Audits** (Icon: two linked circles with arrows, one containing a magnifying glass)
Independent, risk-based internal audits are conducted periodically to assess control effectiveness. We also conduct regular customer audits to validate operational and financial controls.

<::VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ONE - STOP SHOP flowchart::>VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ONE - STOP SHOP<::
The flowchart illustrates a vertically integrated one-stop shop process, starting with "Design & New Product Development" as a central, circular hub.

From "Design & New Product Development", there are two main paths:

1.  **Rapid Prototyping** (image: a 3D printer in operation).

2.  **PCB Design & Analysis** (image: people in a cleanroom working with equipment) and **Cable Assembly** (image: a bundle of multi-colored ribbon cables).

From PCB Design & Analysis and Cable Assembly, the process moves to:

*   **PCB Assembly** (image: a green circuit board with components).
*   **Sheet Metal** (image: stacked metal sheets).

From PCB Assembly and Sheet Metal, the process continues to:

*   **Machining** (image: a machine precisely working on a circuit board).
*   **Magnetics** (image: a large copper coil inductor).
*   **Plastics** (image: white plastic molded components).

From Machining, the process proceeds to:

*   **System Integration** (image: a populated circuit board).

All these paths eventually converge into **Box Build** (image: workers assembling products on an assembly line).

From Box Build, the process goes to:

*   **Functional Testing** (image: a circuit board connected to testing equipment).

There is also a feedback loop from Box Build labeled **Reverse Logistics** which branches into **Repair** and **Logistics**, both leading back to Box Build.

Below the central "Design & New Product Development" hub, the process leads to **Enhance customer value Proposition**, which also connects into the main flow.

Corporate
Governance

<a id='fe26d9ba-ba4c-422c-9a6b-1025c5acce5b'></a>

During the year under review, we took steps to strengthen our internal governance by formalising operational reporting structures, enhancing financial oversight, and increasing the involvement of senior leadership in cross-functional reviews. Progress was made toward aligning internal processes with industry's best practices to improve transparency and ensure responsible decision-making at the board level.

<a id='e94c660a-b432-4c92-ab70-18f426bc3144'></a>

Compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements is maintained through
periodic audits, internal reviews, and
consultation with legal and financial
advisors. Awareness around compliance
expectations is communicated during
onboarding, and the company is
working towards building a more
structured training and monitoring
system in the near future.

<a id='65a58b99-b7ea-4743-a9ba-11b6b11ec9cc'></a>

Ethical norms are upheld by promoting a culture of integrity and responsibility across teams. The company is gradually implementing more structured compliance checklists and documentation standards to monitor adherence across its operations in India and the USA.

<a id='21fc984f-4fd8-41e3-bab1-9ffe11038964'></a>

While formal ethics and compliance
training programs are still in the early
stages of development, we prioritise
integrity and professional conduct
during the leadership hiring process,
with an emphasis on thorough
background checks and reference
validations.

# Economic Overview

## Global Economy¹

In CY 2024, the global economy grew by 3.3% despite major economic shocks. In response to these headwinds, governments responded with policy reforms to boost supply chain resilience and economic diversification. The US economy outperformed expectations, driven by strong domestic demand and private consumption growth of 2.8%. In contrast, Europe faced weak domestic demand due to low consumer confidence and high uncertainty. Global inflation eased from 6.6% in CY 2023 to 5.7% in CY 2024, aided by effective monetary policies and stable energy markets. Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) grew at 4.3%, outpacing advanced economies (1.8%) due to strong domestic demand and increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

<a id='5b81309b-56b6-4a03-8985-ae92129f5187'></a>

## Outlook

The global economy is projected to grow at a steady pace, with estimated growth of 2.8% in CY 2025 and 3.0% in CY 2026, supported by easing inflation and targeted policy interventions by central banks. Emerging markets are expected to expand by 3.7%, while advanced economies may see a modest recovery at 1.4%. With inflation likely to fall to 4.2% in CY 2025 and 3.5% in CY 2026, consumer spending is expected to rise.

<a id='9e2e5a49-2d26-4b58-8c87-8e4d2419abd7'></a>

In light of current uncertainties in global trade, both governments and businesses are actively exploring new markets and improving supply chain efficiency. Further, a strong emphasis on enhancing productivity through technological advancements and smarter infrastructure is expected to drive sustained growth and support a renewed trajectory of global development.

## Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy:

## Cautionary statement
The Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) section often includes statements about future prospects. These statements, which address both known and unknown risks and uncertainties, can lead to significant differences between actual outcomes and the predictions made. The report's estimates rely on the Company's assumptions, which consider the most recent internal and external data. However, keep in mind that the underlying factors behind these assumptions can change over time, potentially affecting the estimates. It's essential to recognize that forward-looking statements apply only to the date they are made and reflect the Company's current intentions, beliefs, or assumptions. The Company is not obligated to revise or update these statements based on new information or future events.

## Key Audit Matters
### Evaluation of uncertain tax positions and litigations :
The Company has on-going legal matters related to direct and indirect taxes which requires significant management judgement to determine the likely outcome.

<a id='819ca571-8016-4df5-9d25-936a3782b0e8'></a>

These matters are considered key audit matters given the
magnitude of potential outflow of economic resources and
uncertainty of potential outcome.

The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the letter from the management, Director's Report, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility Report and Corporate Governance Report but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

<a id='751e0df4-52e1-4255-a886-1c42e906d166'></a>

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

<a id='cf5fccec-b281-4f2d-afb1-40bf9e79f288'></a>

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above, when it becomes available and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

<a id='b14ef747-7dda-4b5a-bdbc-262547003247'></a>

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to communicate the matter to those charged
with governance. We have nothing to report in this regard.

<a id='cb1cd1aa-8663-4b9f-b8f9-fcc2d8d84753'></a>

**Management's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements**
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

<a id='85bd2716-d460-4aa2-953d-7756cf97c4c3'></a>

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board
of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the management either intends
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.

<a id='7821a752-dff5-4882-9bfd-714c0b913f16'></a>

**Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

<a id='246bba08-9800-4351-b50d-e0480b4600b5'></a>

As a part of an audit in accordance with the SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

<a id='df01913e-df04-4213-8579-63b039930e47'></a>

We also,

*   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentation or the override of internal control.
*   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate Internal Financial Controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
*   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
*   Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
*   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

<a id='33bf390c-d0bd-4b11-b930-03835e5c4dd0'></a>

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.

<a id='ea703d32-36ca-4fd9-86b7-32c512eeca54'></a>

We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings including
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.

<a id='cb4278cd-c8eb-497a-b23e-3e6a488a556c'></a>

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, related safeguards.

<a id='0a05bed3-7432-4770-bdab-f8474319c62d'></a>

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our audit's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonable by expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

<a id='b5b29c92-07c9-412b-94c5-22e054f90a32'></a>

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
standalone financial statements based on our audit.

<a id='c68c28a1-2ba2-46a1-92c1-aaf00dbf658e'></a>

We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the
accounting and auditing standards and matters which
are required to be included in the audit report under the
provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under.

<a id='af8799e4-e745-498d-86bb-19035aa5969d'></a>

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

<a id='c2dd0cc0-56c6-4b2c-a53b-bd562b2c1354'></a>

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the Company's preparation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Company's Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

<a id='cb5acef4-afe5-4950-9120-1c9670f72cea'></a>

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

## Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance

<a id='cb5ba921-1e86-4577-81e7-eb04af2dcc80'></a>

Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

<a id='399bed02-01d0-4349-a696-1213c2636e68'></a>

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

<a id='a3433497-28ce-40c4-ae6a-1b58c23efe84'></a>

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system
over financial reporting.

**Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting**
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally

option Corporate Overview: [ ]
option Statutory Reports: [ ]
option Financial Statements: [x]

<a id='67d7b9dc-2554-4cb6-b087-db90cc771aeb'></a>

accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and

<a id='c507925a-7c5d-406d-a561-d0d4417ac412'></a>

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

<a id='8004a5fd-f3da-4644-90ab-4d42dd2ec3a0'></a>

**Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting** Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the

<a id='76678a6a-bab1-4b98-95da-24e00728ffcc'></a>

internal financial controls over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial
control over financial reporting may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## 2. Material Accounting Policies

a. **Basis of Preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India ('Indian GAAP') to comply with the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value.

<a id='3084f0c2-5052-4f98-9628-337e2952c6e6'></a>

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation
of the financial statements are consistent with those
followed in the previous year.

<a id='b0c72189-f8b7-4085-bf86-bed5ef25d743'></a>

Based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

<a id='5ef73380-8f7a-4347-a0b1-c60f81b1b3ba'></a>

**b. Use of Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of Income and expenses during the year. Examples of such estimates include provisions for doubtful receivables, provision for income taxes, the useful lives of depreciable property, plant and equipment and provision for impairment. Future results could differ due to changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual result and the estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/materialise.

<a id='6af0d3b5-3a9a-4c62-9007-9cbfb28af215'></a>

c. **Functional and Presentation currency**
These financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees which is the company's functional currency and all values are presented as Rs. In lakh except where specified and for number of shares.

<a id='13775abf-8243-43bb-b487-4434a75a6228'></a>

d. **Principles of Consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on the following basis:

<a id='ac67b2e2-e1c7-46ee-a08b-557c642558a6'></a>

The financial statements of the company and its subsidiary have been combined on line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after fully eliminating intra group balances and intra group transactions resulting in unrealised profits or losses.

<a id='b9d15c31-ab33-43ef-8c7d-02c7d08db593'></a>

e. **Property, Plant and Equipment**
Freehold land is carried at historical cost.

<a id='04f9ed6e-1466-4f6d-a618-63e069d380a6'></a>

All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost which includes capitalised borrowing cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Cost includes purchase price including non-refundable duties and taxes, expenditure directly attributable to bring the assets to the location and condition necessary for its intended use.

<a id='b42df8ac-dbe2-4850-9cc0-7861a09416c8'></a>

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is possible that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the company.

<a id='5f7c4f6b-e9e5-41fa-830a-efced297d137'></a>

Intangible assets are recognised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the company and the cost of assets can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and accumulated amortisation, if any.

<a id='209be86f-e57e-4540-91b6-be961b6c4664'></a>

f. **Depreciation and Amortization**

g. **Impairment of Assets**
At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment. Recoverable amount is the higher of an

asset's net selling price and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected
from the continuing use of the asset and from its
disposal are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market
assessments of time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. Reversal of impairment loss is
recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss.

<a id='9a02208e-9bb8-4922-8172-b599c0f3809b'></a>

h. **Investment**

The company has accounted for its investments in subsidiary/ies, associates and joint ventures at cost less impairment loss, if any.

Other investments that are readily realisable and intended to be held for not more than a year are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non-current investments.

Current investments are carried at lower of cost and fair value determined on an individual investment basis.

Non-current investments are carried at cost. However, provision for diminution in value is made to recognise a decline, other than temporary, in the value of these investments.

<a id='8b92ace1-4ea2-4fda-aeea-23e9a992c657'></a>

**i. Inventories**
Inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventories is determined on a First In First Out (FIFO) after providing for obsolence and other losses as considered necessary.

<a id='f783d446-da07-4746-8866-cdc910b06862'></a>

Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the
inventories, conversion cost and the cost incurred in
bringing them to their present location and condition.

<a id='d1367c97-bf6a-46f8-9d0e-807fb3a5bdba'></a>

## Basis of Opinion

We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the standards on auditing specified under the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financials statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics.

<a id='ea494c20-ce97-4019-8ebc-560b7c00a122'></a>

## Key Audit Matters
### Evaluation of uncertain tax positions and litigations :
The Company has on-going legal matters related to direct and indirect taxes which requires significant management judgement to determine the likely outcome.

<a id='e2270399-a795-4f44-955e-0f45c799df28'></a>

These matters are considered key audit matters given the
magnitude of potential outflow of economic resources and
uncertainty of potential outcome.

<a id='b48a247e-de22-406d-ac82-941f37ab8674'></a>

Refer note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.

In assessing the potential exposure of the on-going litigation,
we have performed the following procedures :
* Obtaining from the management details of all
completed/pending tax assessments and other
litigations upto March 31, 2025.

The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the letter from the management, Director's Report, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility Report and Corporate Governance Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

<a id='02aaee3b-b997-4ef9-97e5-75e462c743d3'></a>

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

<a id='d5cab6f7-d38d-4a97-9ec4-7471a340d59b'></a>

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
identified above, when it becomes available and in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or
our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

<a id='624a5f9b-e526-4447-a1ed-341f25736be9'></a>

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to communicate the matter to those charged
with governance. We have nothing to report in this regard.

<a id='89de6c70-6c4b-42a1-adbe-f8badb0c8993'></a>

## Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

<a id='3669915a-89c9-439d-a5a4-b06ee36ea7dd'></a>

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board
of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the management either intends
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.

<a id='7bde67aa-90ed-4f95-ab8a-754e9b6d5945'></a>

The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the
Company's financial reporting process.

<a id='f6ff2fc4-9351-49e0-b851-ed7d3bdf6176'></a>

Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

<a id='63f31362-8a3c-444e-ab14-183eb8968422'></a>

As a part of an audit in accordance with the SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

<a id='f129f8cf-5867-46f2-9e57-13911671a847'></a>

We also,

*   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentation or the override of internal control.
*   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate Internal Financial Controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
*   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
*   Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
*   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

<a id='a92fee4f-916e-4e43-9f9d-094a439a0e66'></a>

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

<a id='d2ab942f-3ef5-41bb-a671-597296e81da8'></a>

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

<a id='09cd4056-5e56-453a-bd46-8024a0d6a2ce'></a>

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, related safeguards.

<a id='a35f9554-5c37-4664-b89d-c65364ea58b3'></a>

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our audit's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonable by expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

<a id='665c9ba1-084a-497a-a21f-d9381b66bd50'></a>

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

<a id='2533e8b2-0921-4fa1-8ccd-549e37d76421'></a>

We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the
accounting and auditing standards and matters which
are required to be included in the audit report under the
provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under.

<a id='cf9411b3-0d58-4af9-b9f8-dd15da896e33'></a>

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards
on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Those
Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free
from material misstatement.

<a id='175ef6ab-fa1c-4002-bb4d-92a51be83053'></a>

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the Company's preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Company's Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

<a id='18da6b87-d856-4b0f-a8f0-494f10685059'></a>

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

**Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting**

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the

<a id='481a68ae-f473-4ba5-8f8d-7c9277da3b6c'></a>

internal financial controls over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial
control over financial reporting may become inadequate

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India ('Indian GAAP') to comply with the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value.

<a id='9a523525-bcf3-4f9f-ae26-bd03ac8b7563'></a>

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation
of the financial statements are consistent with those
followed in the previous year.

<a id='b03baec0-e995-4330-a43e-33117aeacafb'></a>

Based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

<a id='342e2660-7b74-405a-ae98-3baf3f1f8799'></a>

b. **Use of Estimates**
The preparation of financial statements requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of Income and expenses during the year. Examples of such estimates include provisions for doubtful receivables, provision for income taxes, the useful lives of depreciable property, plant and equipment and provision for impairment. Future results could differ due to changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual result and the estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/materialise.

g. **Impairment of Assets**
At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss.

h. **Investment**

The company has accounted for its investments in subsidiary/ies, associates and joint ventures at cost less impairment loss, if any.

m. **Employee Benefits**

**Post Employment Benefit Plans :**

1.  **Short Term Employee Benefits:**

    All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, bonus, leave salary, allowances etc. are recognised as actual amounts due in period in which the employee renders the related services.

2.  **Defined Contribution Plans :**

    Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund are a defined contribution scheme and the contributions are charged to the statement of profit and loss of the year when the contribution to the respective funds are due. There are no other obligations other than the contribution payable to the respective funds.

3.  **Defined Benefit Plans :**

    The company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has completed 5 years of more of service is eligible for gratuity on past employment at 15 days salary for such completed years of services as per the rules of the company. The aforesaid liability is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation at the end of the financial year. The said qualifying amount is provided for in the profit and loss statement.

liability at the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the balance sheet date.

<a id='d183aaf5-4c54-47e1-b039-9e259cd4a6d5'></a>

n. **Foreign Currency Transactions**

<a id='229fa114-7778-498d-8673-d5c74c0fbf4c'></a>

liabilities other than net investments in non-integral foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Exchange difference arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of an enterprise's net investments in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.

<a id='4424f86b-af69-4fff-97bb-2db58f3034c2'></a>

o. **Taxation**

Current income tax expense comprises taxes on income from operations in India and in foreign jurisdictions. Income tax payable in India is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Tax expense relating to foreign operations is determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are domiciled.

<a id='2760a714-24a6-464d-9766-14fb9723faed'></a>

Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which gives rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability, is considered as an asset if there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax after the tax holiday period. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with it will fructify.

<a id='afe11ffa-86a3-4cf8-b18b-cfcf6f9d440e'></a>

Deferred tax expense or benefit is recognised on timing differences being the difference between taxable income and accounting income that originate in one period and is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

<a id='7e572cef-4eb1-4ce0-81b4-648598e12fc4'></a>

Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the Company is able to and intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

<a id='2b6b7b52-42f9-48a6-b6b5-d4f317c1cee5'></a>

The Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right and

<a id='908020d4-c4c3-4973-bed2-3b6de3a71f2d'></a>

q. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made. Provisions (excluding retirement benefits and compensated absences) are not discounted to its present value and are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
