In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Change in estimated useful life of tower assets - Refer to Notes 1, 3, 4, and 5 to the financial statements.**

*Critical Audit Matter Description*

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets, effective as of January 1, 2024. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets should be changed from 20 years to 30 years. Additionally, consistent with the useful life of the tower assets, the Company changed the useful life of certain intangible assets as well as lease terms used to measure the right of use assets and lease liabilities.

<a id='aae9253d-ceba-4a91-9418-3cb9a3442112'></a>

The Company accounted for the change in useful life as a change in accounting estimate and applied the change on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company began depreciating its tower assets and amortizing certain intangible assets over the extended useful life. The change in useful life resulted in (i) a $515 million increase to the right of use assets and related lease liabilities as of January 1, 2024 and (ii) an estimated $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.

<a id='276f7e2b-6536-48c0-9aaa-c4b0176ee1ab'></a>

We identified the change in estimated useful life of tower assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support the useful life of the tower assets. There was a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating

management's assumptions and estimates and required the assistance of valuation specialists to validate the appropriateness of assumptions made by management.

<a id='b4a516d3-dfdb-4616-ac8b-6e685805a051'></a>

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the change in estimated useful life of tower assets included the following, among others:

* We inquired of management and operations and engineering personnel to understand the process to build, inspect, and maintain tower assets.
* We inquired of management's independent consultant to understand the processes and procedures that were used to develop the revised estimates of useful life.
* We utilized our fair value specialists that possess relevant engineering expertise to assist us with:
    * Assessing the technical specifications of the Company's towers and the Company's operating procedures, as those specifications and procedures impact the useful life of the towers.
    * Performing independent research on the useful life of towers.
* For a selection of countries, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the tower data used by the Company in supporting the change in estimated useful life.
* We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the development of the estimates of the useful life of the tower assets and the controls over measuring and recognizing the financial statement impacts of the change in estimate.
* With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in lease accounting, we evaluated the Company's conclusions regarding the accounting for the impact of the change in estimated useful life of the tower assets on the right of use assets and operating lease liabilities.
