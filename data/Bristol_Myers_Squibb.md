### Foreign Exchange Risk

Significant amounts of our revenues, earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency forward and purchased local currency put option contracts are used to manage risk primarily arising from certain intercompany sales, third party sales and purchases transactions.

We are also exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk arising from non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset these exposures but are not designated as hedges. Foreign currency forward contracts are also used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain international affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments.

We estimate that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar (with all other variables held constant) would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange contracts by $455 million and $409 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, reducing earnings over the remaining life of the contracts.

Cross-currency swap contracts are used to manage risk arising from long-term debt denominated in euros and to hedge the Company's net investment in its foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar (with all other variables held constant) would increase the fair value of cross-currency swap contracts by $49 million as of December 31, 2024 and increase by $46 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

**Interest Rate Risk**

We use fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges to provide an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. We use cross-currency swap contracts designated to manage risk arising from long-term debt denominated in euros and to hedge the Company's net investment in its foreign subsidiaries. The fair values of these contracts as well as our marketable debt securities are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, if there was a 1% increase in short-term or long-term interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the expected adverse impact on our earnings would not be material.

We estimate that an increase of 1% in long-term interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.

## Credit Risk

We monitor our investments with counterparties with the objective of minimizing concentrations of credit risk. Our investment policy is to invest only in institutions that meet high credit quality standards and establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any individual counterparty. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards.

<a id='cb6b2e8d-f15c-43ca-ac0a-1b61a5cefadd'></a>

The use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk if the counterparty fails to perform when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive. If the counterparty fails to perform, collateral is not required by any party whether derivatives are in an asset or liability position. We have a policy of diversifying derivatives with counterparties to mitigate the overall risk of counterparty defaults. For additional information, refer to "Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements."
