Report of Management

<a id='099da50a-c533-4a84-bf65-8edf66d6f3e7'></a>

**Management's Report on Financial Statements**
Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of information in the consolidated financial statements, including estimates and judgments. The consolidated financial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management believes the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

<a id='eacfc1f0-233d-4ded-9337-68932b719765'></a>

**Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

<a id='604e4b75-df1d-44a4-9157-12ed2c742263'></a>

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
* Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets.
* Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors.
* Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

<a id='59d1a4f3-8ee5-404b-be31-033043467206'></a>

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

<a id='f7be74b4-9320-4e85-9ba1-9389a101b263'></a>

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in *Internal Control — Integrated Framework* (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

<a id='85ce0d52-b18f-465c-9ca0-6999a340424c'></a>

## Audit Committee Oversight
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has oversight responsibility for our financial reporting process and the audits of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm (collectively, the "auditors") to review matters related to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting (including compliance matters related to our Code of Conduct), and the nature, extent, and results of internal and external audits. Our auditors have full and free access and report directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in this Form 10-K.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Comcast Corporation

<a id='45982294-e7e8-4597-8f2d-06b887a52215'></a>

**Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting**
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Comcast Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in *Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)* issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

<a id='7da54073-2e9e-4f05-a898-7ab702426961'></a>

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

<a id='beb46842-332e-45c9-9a5c-1651e123ee4b'></a>

## Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying _Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

<a id='c90a41e5-6368-4162-9930-3a0466cada4a'></a>

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

<a id='c9b6f71d-5891-4940-9714-8b9484dcd787'></a>

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

<a id='2e29f2c0-833d-4fcb-8dad-5d52c5c99dd8'></a>

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

<a id='aaed1e86-9370-4e06-96ce-c2aa4c717bf4'></a>

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<a id='58c106a1-0698-4c1c-a1cf-6b6bc4a512ca'></a>

## Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

<a id='901bba70-6d71-4813-9912-030e61c70fdd'></a>

*Revenue - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements.*

*Critical Audit Matter Description*

The Company's Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment generates revenue from customers that subscribe to broadband and wireless connectivity services, video services and wireline voice services. These services are offered to customers individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate.

<a id='102e375a-4dc0-4057-85c3-ccbdcc338a1d'></a>

The processing and recording of revenue are reliant upon multiple information technology (IT) systems.
Given the volume of data and the number of IT systems, subjective auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue recognition for bundled services within the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment, including the involvement of professionals with expertise in IT to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems and automated controls used in processing revenue transactions.

<a id='bc7b6f5e-b752-4010-baeb-5a6ef70e3800'></a>

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the judgments necessary to determine the appropriate recognition and processing of revenue included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of controls in the revenue recognition processes, including those in place to (a) establish revenue recognition accounting policies for bundled services, (b) record revenue, including any related discounts, in accordance with the established accounting policies, and (c) reconcile the various systems to the Company's general ledger.
*   With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:
    *   Identified the relevant systems and databases used to process revenue transactions and tested the relevant IT controls over each of those systems and databases.
    *   Performed testing of automated business controls over revenue from domestic residential and business customers.
*   We tested the allocation of revenue for bundled services by selecting a sample of subscriber invoices, evaluating management's determination of the transaction price and the distinct performance obligations, and recalculating the allocation of transaction price to each performance obligation based on the respective stand-alone selling prices.
*   We tested the accuracy and completeness of the subscriber information used in our audit procedures by selecting a sample of the subscribers, and for those selections agreeing the selected subscriber information to supporting documentation.
*   We developed expectations of revenue at a disaggregated level based on historical transaction prices, changes in stand-alone selling prices and current year volumes. We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year. We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.

_**Goodwill - Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.**_
_**Critical Audit Matter Description**_
The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. To determine its reporting units, the Company evaluates the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.

<a id='8277fa8b-8b7d-477f-b0df-46ccd00bf1c1'></a>

The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.

<a id='cc5725c4-d856-4e25-b144-1f9c006dcdb8'></a>

The goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.

<a id='660afb4d-d40e-4df8-9807-bcbd6df5d86a'></a>

We identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, when performing audit procedures to evaluate management's conclusion related to the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit and the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows for the Media reporting unit.

<a id='f04bbef0-d7fb-4937-88fe-24b7eb6dfd9e'></a>

## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures to evaluate the determination of the reporting unit as well as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over (a) the accounting policies regarding identification of the unit of account for goodwill and (b) the determination of the fair value of Media, such as controls related to management's selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.
*   With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
*   We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.

<a id='fb023516-7d48-4f39-b039-484e2aa689a6'></a>

*Income Taxes - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements.*

*Critical Audit Matter Description*

The Company completed an internal corporate reorganization which resulted in a federal net capital loss of $9.1 billion, which can be carried back three years. Given capital gains recognized in prior federal income tax returns, the Company recognized an income tax benefit and a corresponding refund receivable of $1.9 billion.

<a id='48274fc4-558b-4bcf-844b-f8790f153d7d'></a>

We identified the accounting for the tax benefit as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required to (1) determine whether the tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of the tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing the Company's accounting for this position required a high degree of auditor judgment, specialized knowledge, and involvement of our tax specialists.

<a id='d39c29a6-e7dd-4087-88ce-4fbbc921fdb0'></a>

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the tax benefit associated with the internal corporate reorganization included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's determination of the tax position and the measurement of the tax benefit.
*   With the assistance of our tax specialists, we:
    *   Evaluated management's memoranda and third-party opinions used by management to support its position and the related accounting impacts.
    *   We assessed the consistency of management's position with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.
    *   Assessed management's methods and assumptions used in calculating the capital loss and measuring the tax benefit.
    *   Recalculated the tax basis of the entities included in the calculation of the capital loss by comparing the amounts to supporting evidence and evaluating the appropriateness of management's assumptions used to determine the tax basis.
