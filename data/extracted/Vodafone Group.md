THE CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

<a id='add01807-b45a-4dba-b57f-7538d7f50be9'></a>

Dear Shareholders,

<a id='bc3a83df-da32-48d7-82d5-1a9dcf15a994'></a>

## India in the Global Economy:

The global economy has been marked with volatility in 2025 due to trade tensions, geo-politics and the drums of war. Despite challenging global conditions, India remains a bright spot - one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, projected to grow at a rapid clip of 6.2 percent this year. Digital infrastructure and connectivity have emerged as significant driver of economic growth in India. The advent of mobile technology and the internet has bridged the digital divide, bringing connectivity to rural and urban areas alike. The proliferation of affordable smartphones and data plans has revolutionized how Indians access information, conduct business, and communicate. This connectivity has integrated technology into the fabric of daily life and commerce. The digital divide, though narrowed, still exists, particularly in rural areas and is a growth opportunity.

## Funding and Investment Cycle

Even amid a challenging environment, your Company has
demonstrated confidence in its future by successfully completing

<!-- PAGE BREAK -->

<a id='0513f74e-dd73-4cb3-bb32-3b3146e3bc03'></a>

substantial equity raise of ~ ₹ 245 billion, including FPO of
₹ 180 billion, preferential issue of ~ ₹ 40 billion to promoters and
~ ₹ 25 billion to vendors. In addition to the above spectrum dues
of ~ ₹ 369 billion to the Government of India converted into equity,
resulting in a government equity ownership of 49% in your Company.

<a id='e942bb97-9a4b-4ad1-8b62-e5a68e7aad96'></a>

Following the fund raise, your Company entered into major network agreements worth approximately ₹ 300 billion with three global technology partners-Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung-to initiate full-scale network deployment in October 2024. This marked the beginning of our transformative three-year capex cycle, estimated at ₹ 500-550 billion, out of which ₹ 74.4 billion have already been invested in this year. During the year, we have made significant progress in expanding our network footprint, we added a net ~14,100 broadband towers, almost equivalent to the net cumulative addition of ~14,900 towers in the last four years. These early investments have significantly enhanced network coverage and capacity, resulting in a better customer experience. 4G population coverage expanded by 73 million, reaching approximately 83% in March 2025 up from 77% from an year ago. Simultaneously, 4G data capacity increased by about 31%, contributing to a nearly 28% improvement in 4G speeds. Your Company has launched 5G across multiple cities and it is progressing steadily in a phased manner. This marks just the beginning of a broader investment cycle.

services industry for the year ended March 31, 2025 as per TRAI Data. During the year ended March 31, 2025, your Company had a leading ApGR market share in the Mumbai and Kerala service areas, and the second largest ApGR market share in Gujarat.

<a id='eaaa0c08-5755-427e-bf68-39eabc7f7743'></a>

Our ARPU has risen for 15 consecutive quarters, supported by strategic tariff increases and consistent customer upgrades. Our gross subscriber acquisition share has outperformed our subscriber market share for past several quarters, underscoring our competitive edge to attract new users. We have also seen lower decline in the subscriber base in Q4FY25, post the revival of investments from Q3FY25 and we expect such trend to continue as we expand our 4G coverage and launch our 5G services. Our 4G subscriber base has grown in 14 out of the last 15 quarters, with the only decline observed in Q2FY25, where loss of subscribers happened post a tariff hike.

<a id='822e8174-6c03-48b9-9efc-eda7d467c48e'></a>

Your Company is confident that this positive trend will continue as we sustain the current pace of capex deployment and build a resilient business.

## Outlook

Looking ahead, we are confident that this positive trajectory will continue as we sustain the current pace of network investments, digital expansion, and operational excellence. The Government, now the largest public shareholder with a 49 percent equity stake, has been a key pillar in our transformation journey.

## INDIAN WIRELESS SECTOR

In the early 2000s, wireless connectivity was a privilege available to only a few. In 2001, India's tele-density i.e the number of telephone connections per 100 people --- stood at a mere 3.5, making even a basic phone call inaccessible for many. Fast forward to 2025, and what was once considered a luxury has become a fundamental part of daily life. With tele-density surging to 82.4% and the cost of voice calls plummeting, connectivity is not only affordable but ubiquitous. This remarkable transformation has not only redefined communication but has also turned once-distant aspirations into everyday experiences. Today, India boasts the world's second-largest telecommunications sector, serving over a billion people. The sector is contributing approximately 6% to the national GDP (including Infrastructure, Equipment, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, White Space Spectrum, 5G, Telephone service providers and Broadband).

<a id='ac6cc67e-55b2-4f9c-80c5-16ad4cdca37c'></a>

The widespread availability of affordable mobile devices and internet services has accelerated digital adoption, bridging gaps and connecting communities across the country. The sector marked significant progress in connectivity, digital inclusion, technological advancement, and regulatory reforms i.e all aligned with the government's Digital India vision. From the rapid rollout of newer technologies to the policies aimed at enhancing infrastructure and user experience, these initiatives have played a vital role in fostering inclusive growth and seamless communication.

<a id='1f8f42f8-5fa3-49da-84cf-227fe864e361'></a>

India's telecom journey has become a case study in global transformation. Unlike many other nations that viewed telecom as a commercial service, India recognized it as a powerful tool for equity and empowerment, a force that continues to narrow the divide between urban and rural populations, and between the privileged and the underserved.

<a id='db4b2ba4-da52-416f-8f0e-a2c6c0d79cd5'></a>

Let's take a look at the Indian telecom scenario in last decade:

* Wireless connections grew from 969.9 Mn in March 2015 to 1,157 Mn in March 2025.

<a id='3eac7e2a-5d77-49aa-add1-def237bc9185'></a>

*   Overall tele-density rose from 77.3% in March 2015 to 82.4% in March 2025.
*   Rural telephone connections grew by 26.9%, more than double the urban increase, from 414.2 Mn in March 2015 to 525.6 Mn in March 2025.
*   Broadband connections jumped from 83.68 Mn in March 2015 to 902.7 Mn in March 2025, a growth of 978.8%.
*   Average monthly data consumption per wireless data subscriber (GSM) increased from 89 MB in March 2015 to 22 GB in March 2025.
*   Average minutes of usage per subscriber (GSM) increased 2.7 times from 383 minutes in March 2015 to 1,026 minutes in March 2025.

<a id='b5e98427-d1b0-4d8d-b18d-31f031c15444'></a>

Wireless connectivity has become the backbone of India's digital ecosystem, connecting over a billion people across diverse geographies. Telecom companies have made substantial investments in wireless infrastructure - providing extensive 4G coverage covering and, rolling out 5G networks across India. The criticality of having a robust wireless sector has been authenticated multiple times, including during the COVID 19 pandemic, where it enabled remote working, digital education, telemedicine and e-commerce, keeping the economy and essential services functioning and in times of geopolitical tension or natural disasters, when the wireless network ensures real time communication, coordination and crisis response.

<a id='4ff213da-4b4d-453d-8d53-729e2d1e5e7f'></a>

Over the last decade, the wireless operators have made very
large investments in acquiring spectrum and expansion of
network infrastructure - be it 4G to address the growing
customer demand or rolling out an advanced technology
like 5G where the customer demand is still evolving to
support the Digital India Vision of our Hon'ble Prime Minister.
However, the sector faces significant challenges.

<a id='f1027464-27b9-404d-a2fa-020cf26f2175'></a>

On the back of these investments, India has improved its global ranking in mobile broadband speed from 118th to 15th in a report published by the Portulans Institute, an independent non-profit research and educational institute based in Washington DC. The surge in connectivity demand across all demographics, driven by diverse income groups, age segments, and evolving customer behavior, has also boosted India's ranking in the Network Readiness Index

report.

<a id='65ca8ae9-fd89-456d-8a02-86a5a84891fb'></a>

However, despite this impressive growth, overall broadband penetration still remains below 65% representing a significant opportunity for further growth with higher adoption of broadband services.

<a id='41c48621-caa9-4b67-9739-96995d75a2de'></a>

It may be noted that India has one of the lowest ARPUs in the world making it challenging for telcos to sustain investment and innovation. The private mobile operators hiked tariff in July 2024 after more than two years since the previous price increase in November 2021, leading to improvements in ARPU and revenue. However, despite the price increase, the ARPU in India remains as one of the lowest globally and the industry's ROCE continues to remain below cost of capital. Further, the telecom sector requires significant investments to support emerging technologies, and meet the rapid increase in data consumption, further accelerated by rapid AI advancements.

<a id='a03c095c-b921-405a-8d6c-b24040042c9e'></a>

Therefore, to ensure a fair return on significant investments and support future capital expenditure in the telecom industry, further tariff increases are essential. Additionally, the industry needs to return to a pricing model where heavy data users contribute more proportionally to their higher usage, than the current pricing structure where incremental data usage comes at an extremely low and unsustainable marginal price.

With low penetration and potential ARPU growth, India continues to remain an attractive market for telecom industry despite the past challenges of hyper-competition and subsequent financial stress in the sector. The consolidation of the industry to three private operators and one government operator positions the industry well to benefit from the growth opportunities on the back of India's digitalization trend and Government's vision of Digital India.

In line with its purpose-led branding, Vi launched the emotionally resonant '**Be Someone's We (V!)**' campaign in September 2024, inspired by the belief that connections have the power to transform lives. The campaign reinforced Vi's vision of being a trusted partner in its customers' journey towards a better today and a brighter tomorrow. The second phase of this campaign, rolled out during the Cricket World Cup, highlighted stories of empty nesters navigating loneliness, showcasing Vi's role in fostering real human connections and bridging emotional gaps. The campaign struck a deep emotional chord, appealing to the universal need for belonging and making the world a little less lonely through the power of connectivity. We engaged with younger audiences through a podcast in partnership with Yuvaa called - 'Be A Parent, Yaar!' where the central theme of 'Be Someone's We' was woven into conversations between celebrities and their parents. The interaction with youth was further

To further drive engagement, Vi introduced the high-energy Run Mahotsav during the IPL season-an interactive campaign on the Vi App that encouraged daily participation through gamified experiences, quizzes, and transaction-based rewards. This initiative saw enthusiastic response from users, significantly boosting app engagement and brand interaction. In addition, Vi partnered with leading youth platforms like Spotify, Yuvaa, and Snapchat to co-create content and experiences tailored to younger audiences. These platform-specific collaborations amplified the message of 'Be Someone's We', blending influencer-led storytelling, purposeful digital content, and interactive formats to deepen relevance and emotional connect among Gen Z and millennial consumers.

<a id='3f3dfe1e-2778-4d6c-a38a-d9bac06d0357'></a>

Together, these initiatives reflect Vi's strategic focus on customer-centricity, emotional resonance, and digital innovation, all of which are central to building a truly powerful and enduring brand in today's hyper-connected world.

<a id='3eedef54-c4bc-4338-9c95-ec24eedac848'></a>

With the kickstarting of the Capex cycle post FPO and significant expansion and improvement of the network, we launched hyperlocal campaigns at a massive scale across India which targeted customers with stories of 'Our Best Ever Network' at city, district and locality levels to reiterate the extent and impact of network expansion. This campaign was amplified through OOH, digital, retail, radio and other such local media.

<a id='0f777fc3-f3e0-4bfc-bb00-05713b76317d'></a>

Vi also had a very successful run at the India Mobile Congress 2024 with over 40,000 attendees garnering among the highest footfalls, engagement and media share of voice during that period.

OVERVIEW OF KEY STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

1.  **Focus on Network Investments**

    Your Company's investments had been constrained
    over the past few years due to liquidity challenges.
    Following the recent fundraise, capital expenditure
    (capex) gained significant momentum.

<a id='72b9acb1-639a-4609-b0e3-0bbf09eebe3c'></a>

In H1FY25, your Company launched 'quick win' capex
initiatives, which focused on capitalising on low-
hanging fruits, while working on finalizing long-term
capex contracts.

<a id='1d0b4dd5-6b08-496c-91a8-b3cc91a85fe1'></a>

During the July 2024 spectrum auction, your Company
has acquired 50 MHz of spectrum across low band
and mid band spectrum (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and

<a id='08714519-d682-470a-9842-ca0b60d3e2fd'></a>

2500 MHz) in 11 circles at a total commitment of
‘ 3,510 Crore. Your company holds the highest 4G
spectrum per million subs amongst the 3 private
operators and competitive 5G spectrum in 17 priority
circles, which allows it to offer superior experience to
customers as well as to effectively utilize the spectrum
across existing and emerging technologies.

<a id='dd40a2ae-148f-4611-bb10-c0d36b2c8007'></a>

A major milestone was achieved in September 2024 when your Company concluded contracts for approximately ’300 Bn with three global technology partners-Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung-for the supply of network equipment over a three-year period. This strategic step formed the foundation of the transformative three-year capex plan, which is targeted at overall spends of ’500-550 Bn.

<a id='0dd99065-a02a-4faf-86ae-1121451f1fdf'></a>

Following the execution of these agreements, network deployment began in October 2024, formally kickstarting a full-scale capex cycle. During the year, the Company made significant progress in expanding its network footprint. It added a total of ~14,100 broadband towers-almost equivalent to the net cumulative addition of ~14,900 towers between FY20 and FY24. As previously outlined, your Company aims to increase its broadband tower count to around 215,000-220,000-an addition of over 45,000-50,000 towers compared to March 2024, which will take the 4G population coverage to approximately 90%.

<a id='70b1b4bc-186e-427f-a5cb-19b3d5bd140a'></a>

Your Company continues to enhance sub-GHz
900 MHz band across all 16 spectrum circles adding
approximately 58,400 sites in FY25 to improve overall
coverage and strengthen indoor connectivity. In
addition, around 48,300 sites were added on the 1800
MHz and 2100 MHz bands to boost network capacity
and enable higher data speeds on Vi GIGAnet network.

<a id='7b43d973-245f-4cf3-ab28-c39772760806'></a>

As of March 31, 2025, total broadband site count reached approximately 494,500, up from ~430,700 an year earlier. Your Company is also deploying High-Powered Small Cells-ultra-lean pole sites designed for minimal infrastructure and single-operator use-to address coverage and capacity challenges in densely populated areas, offering enhanced efficiency and lower operational costs.

These early investments have significantly enhanced network coverage and capacity, resulting in an enhanced customer experience. 4G population coverage expanded by 73 Mn, reaching approximately 83%, up from 77% in March 2024. Simultaneously, 4G data capacity increased by about 31%, contributing to a nearly 28% improvement in 4G speeds. This marks just the beginning of a multi-year investment cycle. Consequently, a notable slowdown in subscriber losses caused by lack of investment earlier is observed. Your Company is confident that this positive trend of reduced subscriber loss will continue as we sustain the current pace of capex deployment. Moreover, the phased launch of 5G services is expected to further strengthen subscriber acquisition and retention.

<a id='c03bad4c-b85c-4cdc-b34d-2ec6880504b3'></a>

Your Company initiated the rollout of 5G services in March 2025 and as of date of this report, 5G services are now available in cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chandigarh and Patna. Expansion efforts are underway to offer 5G services in all the 17 circles with 5G spectrum by August 2025. Your Company has the advantage of having the latest 4G equipment and technologies which are capable of upgrading to 5G. Your Company's 4G network has been strategically deployed with a future-proof architecture, and all new basebands and over 90% of the Time Division Duplex ("TDD") 2500 MHz band radio units are 5G-ready with 10G bandwidth capability. Your Company has also deployed various advanced 5G technologies including Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output ("Massive MIMO") for improved capacity, and Open Radio Access Network ("ORAN") for increased flexibility. As of March 31, 2025, your Company deployed ~76,300 TDD radios, ~13,700 Massive MIMO sites, and ~14,900 small cells.

<a id='268b0b9c-3294-4187-93f6-7f01ba3f196b'></a>

Your Company's network also includes new unified roadmap architectures of Virtualized Radio Access network ("vRAN") and ORAN solutions as well as E-band technology. The Pan-India core network is fully equipped to support 5G non-standalone (NSA) technology. This advanced network architecture is designed to handle the high throughput and diverse use cases associated with 5G, encompassing both mobile and enterprise segments. Your Company's 5G-ready architecture enables latency reduction and helps us deliver an enhanced customer experience.

<a id='c53db455-5d1b-4809-b09d-5ba6645be77a'></a>

To complement extensive network upgrades, your
Company launched one of India's most hyperlocal
marketing campaigns aimed at increasing consumer
awareness about the marked improvement in network
performance. The campaign highlights real-world local
success stories and showcases how the network has
truly become "Our Best Ever Network" across cities,
districts, and localities.

<a id='cb6ad9aa-7075-4e31-bc6d-8730d79723d7'></a>

At the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, Vi strengthened its network capacity in the region to handle the high volume of users. Specifically, Vi added 30 new sites in Triveni Sangam, upgraded 272 sites, added 46 small-cells, and laid 32 kilometers of fiber to strengthen the network. Additionally, Vi launched the "Vi Number Rakshak" initiative to reunite lost pilgrims with their families. This initiative provided pilgrims, especially those without phones, with Rudraksh and Tulsi bead bracelets engraved with emergency contact numbers. This not only kept the pilgrims safe but also won appreciation from the local authorities and the lost-and-found pilgrims.

2. **Market initiatives to improve ARPU and drive retention**

With the successful FPO in April 2024, your Company started the year with the promise of a stronger network and the confidence of delivering a superior customer experience during the Financial Year 2024-25. With that cognizance that the capex cycle will start taking effect during the year, your Company took upon the challenge of delivering a strong growth story during the Financial Year with a focus on both customer retention and ARPU growth.

<a id='31c3a0c9-ca9a-45ba-908a-f8eb74901eb4'></a>

In this endeavor, your Company prides itself in always taking the lead in creating innovative, game changing and industry-first propositions in the marketplace, that offer maximum value to the customers and gives them strong reasons to choose us. This allows us to create the necessary differentiation in the marketplace and stay competitive while retaining and upgrading the valuable base of high ARPU customers.

<a id='efcf821d-3967-4994-82cd-009a0d84fdb5'></a>

offering free 5G on all its data plans, it was felt necessary to offer a sufficient counter and attractive benefit for our loyal customers. Vi Guarantee offered the promise '130 GB Data - Milega hi Milega'. All our loyal prepaid customers using 5G or new 4G handsets, who recharged with data plans starting 1GB or more were offered 10 GB extra data during the month, every month for 13 months as long as they continued to recharge on our 1GB+ data plans. This program was launched across the country with significant execution intensity on the ground across our trade and retail channels. The program also garnered significant organic attention on social media with related content garnering over 400 Mn views. This successful program saw participation from over 20 Million customers and a large share of which were shifted from Voice Only or Low ARPU Data Plans to high ARPU Data plans, helping to not only improve our subscriber mix and drive ARPU improvement but also drive retention and boost revenue.

<a id='140ef451-5aa2-4fe2-a410-168e00902b84'></a>

Your Company's priority remains on driving ARPU
improvement. In July 2024, your Company implemented
targeted tariff interventions aimed at improving return
on investments and enhancing cash flow generation—
critical for funding our large-scale network investments.
While these steps are in the right direction, the industry
still requires further tariff rationalization to achieve
sustainable cost-of-capital returns.

<a id='141e7d4b-4661-4e8e-9775-5251f5e5c79e'></a>

The most significant intervention undertaken during the year was the effectuation of tariff revisions at the beginning of Q2. With hyper-competition over the years, industry ARPUs have been unsustainably low and therefore, your Company undertook upward revision or prices of all major voice and data plans. However, given the large strata of customers that we serve, including segments that are extremely price sensitive, your Company also took the balanced approach of retaining some of the old price points with reduced benefits. This balanced approach allowed your Company to maximize ARPU growth while minimizing customer losses, leading to better revenue outcomes compared to earlier occasions when such large-scale panoramic tariff revisions were undertaken.

at a large scale and our network expansion started

taking good effect, we decided to further revitalize our product portfolio to bring our 'Hero' products back into focus. The 'Vi Hero Unlimited' – launched in FY21 and offering free night data (12 AM – 6 AM), Weekend Data Rollover and two turns of Data Delight (free 1GB Data sachet) has been a very successful and popular product that has attracted and retained a large share of our data plan subscribers, allowing us to extract higher ARPU from this audience. This year, we decided to extend it further by introducing the 'Vi Super Hero' at a premium price point. This innovative and game-changing product retains the benefits of hero and extends it further by offering Unlimited data for half day from 12 AM to 12 PM and 2GB/Day for the rest of the day. Furthermore, to offer higher value to our subscribers in some of our opportunity markets such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana and Karnataka, your Company launched the 'Vi Non-Stop Hero' proposition which offered truly Unlimited Data 24x7.

<a id='bcf960d5-bad6-49c8-858c-0f17b573d907'></a>

A combination of differentiated product propositions, marketing initiatives, customer service experience improvements and execution intensity on the ground has been contributing to growth. To address diverse customer needs, we offer a comprehensive range of feature-rich postpaid plans. Your Company also rolled out Vi Max Limitless Postpaid Data Plans across a few markets, offering truly unlimited high-speed data along with premium entertainment content and other value-added services. The postpaid business continues to show robust performance, with consistent growth in the subscriber base on both a quarterly and yearly basis. While much of this growth is driven by the M2M segment, individual postpaid customers have also steadily increased.

<a id='7aadd337-a503-4af1-afab-bb5684fda8af'></a>

To supplement our expanded footprint and ambitious customer growth plans, our company's propositions continue to serve as a core differentiator and attract customers by offering disproportionate value and benefits. Our 'Vi Max Postpaid' plan continues to be the only postpaid plan in the country which offers customers the option of choosing their benefit from a wide array of entertainment and lifestyle options such as Jio Hotstar, SonyLIV, Swiggy One, EazyDiner, Norton and EaseMyTrip.

we also refreshed our premium and flagship 'Vi RedX postpaid' plan, which packs in the best of benefits and disproportionate value that a telecom plan can offer. With bundled offering of Netflix, SonyLIV, Jio Hotstar, EazyDiner and Norton, along with free access to 3 International lounges & 1 Domestic Lounge and a free International Roaming pack worth up to ₹2999 in a year, the RedX plan packs in a formidable punch and helps Vi attract the most elite and premium customers in the market, boosting both ARPU and stickiness.

<a id='d15f7c0c-623e-45f3-ac4e-7270c0778dba'></a>

Post disposal of the representation, the Company
had filed a Writ Petition on May 13, 2025 seeking
appropriate relief/direction in the matter before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, which was dismissed on
May 19, 2025. In the Company's view, this dismissal
does not preclude it from further engaging with the

<a id='a0db09d5-ade2-4d8b-bea4-74c0c88f20e9'></a>

Government of India based on its foreseeable cashflows for arriving at an appropriate solution on the AGR matter before the next instalment date.

<a id='20f8b275-c2aa-4fe4-8beb-f54d88fb4bd7'></a>

• **Issue of Equity Shares to Government of India**
The Telecom Reforms Package of 2021 provided for deferment of AGR dues which are payable in annual instalments as determined by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for up to four years without any change in the instalment period and deferment of spectrum auction instalments payable from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2025 excluding the installments due for spectrum auction conducted in 2021.

• **Spectrum Auction**

In June 2024, your Company acquired 50 MHz of spectrum across low band and mid band spectrum (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2500 MHz) in 11 circles at a total commitment of ₹ 3,510 Crore, at the spectrum auction conducted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). In addition to renewal of 900 MHz spectrum in Uttar Pradesh (West) and West Bengal circles, your Company has also enhanced its 900 MHz spectrum holding in 7 circles, namely Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (East) and Kolkata, enabling it to dedicate adequate 900 MHz band spectrum for 4G thereby enhancing the experience of its 4G customers in these large markets, particularly the indoor experience. In circles of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu (excluding Chennai), Punjab and large parts of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh (East), 4G on sub GHz 900 band will be offered for the first time which will result in better coverage and experience. In addition to 900 MHz spectrum, your Company has also acquired 1800 MHz spectrum in Madhya Pradesh and 2500 MHz spectrum in Bihar, which will help in increasing the network capacity. Your Company already holds sufficient and competitive 5G spectrum in its 17 priority circles.

<a id='de168c45-54dc-4fb2-96c6-ca80dd750bd1'></a>

•   **Bank Guarantee Waiver**

In December 2024, under the Telecom Reforms
Package 2021, the Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) dispensed with the industry's requirement of
submission of Financial Bank Guarantees (BG) for the
Spectrum acquired in Spectrum Auction held in 2012,
2014, 2015, 2016 and 2021, subject to certain terms
and conditions. Prior to this reform, BGs aggregating
to ~₹ 24,800 Crore were required to be provided by

<a id='89b0f435-6a30-404a-a532-26b313d36508'></a>

your Company against each spectrum instalment, 13 months prior to the installment falling due for the above auctions. As per your Company's understanding of the terms and conditions, out of all the 5 auctions mentioned above, no BGs will be required to be provided by your Company for the 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2021 auctions. However, there was a one-time partial shortfall only for the 2015 auction, where the NPV was calculated as ~ ₹ 6000 crore (by way of BG) or ₹ 5500 crore (by way of upfront cash payment), as conveyed by the DoT. This amount was later adjusted in the process of conversion of spectrum dues into equity stake held in April 2025. This step of BG waiver is a clear indication of the Government's continued support to the private players of the Indian telecom industry.

<a id='95b0bf0b-dab0-4b5c-b5a1-efea90e6c4b0'></a>

• One Time Spectrum Charge Matter
In respect of levy of One Time Spectrum Charge ('OTSC'), the DoT has raised demand on the Company and erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (VInl) and Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (VMSL) in January 2013 for spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz in respective service areas for retrospective period from July 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012 and for spectrum held beyond 4.4 MHz in respective service areas effective January 1, 2013 till expiry of the period as per respective licenses.

Similarly erstwhile Vinl and VMSL had filed a petition before the Hon'ble Tribunal Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) which vide its Order dated July 4, 2019 held that for spectrum below 6.2 MHz, OTSC is not chargeable and accordingly demand is set aside. For spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz, if spectrum is allotted after July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from the date of allotment of such spectrum and if spectrum is allotted before July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from January 1, 2013 till the date of expiry of licenses and ordered DoT to issue revised demands, if any, as per terms of direction given.

## REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Revised Quality of Service (QoS) Regulations:** On August 2, 2024, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued the revised QoS Regulations. These Regulations that came into effect from October 1, 2024 further tightened the norms of QoS Performance and Reporting. The key norms include assessments going monthly (from quarterly), strict norms for call drops, coverage maps on TSP websites, soft penalties for network outage in a district for more than 4 hours etc.

*   **The Telecommunications Act, 2023:** On December 24, 2023, the Telecommunications Act 2023 was published. Since then, several Rules have been published under the Act, providing an implementing framework for the enactment of the several provisions of the Act. Most notably, the Rules have been published on:
    *   Right of Way Rules
    *   Digital Bharat Nidhi Rules (erstwhile USOF)
    *   Cyber Security Rules

<a id='0dcce888-756e-4965-99b6-f9853d2300a2'></a>

- Critical Telecom Infrastructure Rules
- Temporary Suspension of Services Rules
- Procedures and Safeguards for Lawful Interception of Messages Rules

<a id='a26127c0-9d87-4464-b692-2a3f889c759f'></a>

Your Company actively contributed to the consultations undertaken by the Government on the Rules and looks forward to their effective implementation.

<a id='89d04123-363e-4678-a5e2-2b59ae47f4b2'></a>

• E-band Spectrum Allocation: On January 28, 2025, the Company was allocated (on its application) E-band Spectrum in Delhi, Mumbai and Bihar for 1 carrier in each LSA necessary for expansion of 5G network.

<a id='39c9b2f1-9f16-4f81-bdea-549fda7a7e86'></a>

• **Amendment to Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCCPR):** On February 12, 2025, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) notified an amendment to the TCCCPR, 2018. As per the amendment, TSPs are required to accept complaints against spam after up to a week of receiving such calls, act on unregistered telemarketers faster (within five days), and impose lower tolerance thresholds for reported spammers.

<a id='2949b57b-c35f-47ff-a86b-859db0be2e7e'></a>

These Regulations are in addition to your Company's significant initiatives to address unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) and protect consumers from fraud. These measures include implementing 140XX and 1600XX telemarketing numbers and integrating them with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform, developing a robust system to block invalid International Long-Distance Operator Codes, introducing URL whitelisting, ensuring linking a business (Principal Entity) with the specific telemarketers they authorize to send messages on their behalf for traceability and accountability in SMS communication and leveraging technologies such as Al and ML to identify and prevent spam in real-time. However, with TSPs taking measures to control spam, the industry is of the view that a collaborative effort is required, including the need of measures by the OTT communication platforms, which also offer communication services to citizens of the country.

Disclosure of particulars with respect to Conservation of Energy, Technology Absorption and Foreign Exchange Earnings and Outgo as prescribed under Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8(3) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.

<a id='f0ff6860-fb13-488a-b77c-bacb30e3a2b9'></a>

A. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Indian telecom industry has been able to penetrate well across the country, where even the grid has not been able to reach in more than half a century. As per license conditions, a telecom operator needs to maintain network availability higher than 99.5%. Assured power 24x7 supply ranging from the load of 15 KW each is, therefore, a pre-requisite for any telecom tower site. One of the biggest challenges being faced now is power deficiency in most of the areas along with lack of power infra, considering the focus of the telecom sector on rural penetration. While expanding the network infrastructure exponentially across the geography of India, Vodafone Idea Limited ("VIL" or "Company") maintained the need for increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption.

<a id='540cf6f0-4bac-4c48-b70e-025449525eb1'></a>

Accordingly, cost-effective energy-efficiency initiatives
were continued across all spectrum of network expansion
in the last Financial Year. This includes, more emphasis
on infrastructure-sharing, deployment of high efficient
network hardware, replacement of high consuming
hardware with more efficient telecom hardware,
increasing the energy efficiency of existing installations
etc. The Company has recently also instituted an Energy
and Carbon Management Policy.

<a id='f1ad259f-af7c-4dd8-b766-41a8d14ca14e'></a>

**(a) Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy:**
During the year under review, several steps were taken for conservation of energy, some of which are listed below:

<a id='3063567a-8ec1-4dd5-a513-0539828c241c'></a>

# Networks

On the Network front, the Company continued to adopt environmentally sustainable practices in their transactions with the same foundational objectives laid down as part of Company's Energy and Carbon Management Policy:

* Consider Energy performance when operating VIL's infrastructure;
* Continue with the procurement of most energy efficient Telecom Hardware; and
* Encourage Infrastructure Provider partners to adopt low carbon operations.

<a id='12c1ff3b-399b-498d-b046-98f21436fa69'></a>

The initiatives undertaken are as below:

*   Over 75% of VIL BTS portfolio - Outdoor BTS (20% reduction in energy consumption compared to Indoor BTS);
*   Diesel elimination project initiated by VIL to reduce carbon footprint currently continued at over 11,700 sites;
*   100% of the telecom hardware procured by the Company is low power consuming telecom hardware;
*   New Sites Deployment on Sharing Basis: >95% of the sites deployed were at existing 2G sites and/or shared sites as part of the mandated initiative to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption;
*   The Company continued active equipment energy saving initiatives like power saving features during low traffic period. All new packet-core deployments as well as new MSS/VoLTE circuit-core deployments use cloud architecture; and
*   RET - solar based generation at over 350 sites.

<a id='d2ff0e5c-c735-46b7-bc25-9fc4cc4c352d'></a>

# Green IT

Apart from Network operations, the Company has also made conscious efforts to make its IT operations greener and more efficient. This has been made possible by adopting sustainable practices and new technologies as listed below:

*   Cloud Computing & Virtualization: The Company has set-up multiple, inter-connected, high capacity servers to provide a huge resource pool and centralized management through Cloud Computing enabling the delivery of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

### Company's Philosophy on Corporate Governance

Corporate Governance refers to mechanisms, processes and relations by which corporations are controlled and directed. The essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting and maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability across all business practices. Corporate Governance essentially involves balancing the interests of Company's Stakeholders, such as shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government and the community.

<a id='3d969eb4-e11a-48e1-b5ff-9e75a0a59e1c'></a>

Corporate Governance has always been intrinsic to the management of the business and affairs of our Company. Given the market and regulatory movements, the Company has continued to inculcate, imbibe and perpetuate governance tenets. Corporate Governance in VIL is a reflection of principles entrenched in our values and policies, leading to value driven growth. At VIL ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability across all business processes is of utmost importance. We believe that good governance practices stem from the culture and mindset of the organization. While making business decisions our objective is to meet stakeholders' interest and societal expectations.

In line with our commitment to reducing emissions and enhancing energy efficiency, we are steadily increasing our use of renewable energy. In FY 2024-25 alone, ~47 Mn kWh of energy was sourced from renewables. We have implemented impactful initiatives within our Commercial Warehouses, including energy efficient infrastructure, solar adoption, and resource reutilization. These efforts have not only led to significant carbon emission reductions and cost savings but have also contributed to the conservation of natural resources - saving 482 trees and redeploying materials worth ₹ 3035 crore in FY25 alone.

We are equally proud of the strides made in promoting diversity and inclusion.

*   **Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Training:** VIL mandates annual refresher training on its anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy for all employees, ensuring that they understand and commit to adhering to the policy's guidelines.

*   **Investigation and Consequences of Misconduct:** VIL follows a formal procedure to investigate and resolve any complaints regarding bribery or corruption. Disciplinary actions are taken as per the Consequence Management Policy and are periodically reported to the Audit Committee of the Board. The severity of the breach determines the appropriate disciplinary action, which can include penalties, legal action, or even termination of employment or business contracts.

2. **Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.**

As part of its strong governance framework, Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) has established robust mechanisms to manage conflicts of interest. The Company's Code of Conduct explicitly requires all Board Members to avoid situations where their personal interests could conflict with the interests of VIL.

<a id='8fdc7f22-d44c-4b7a-8d65-0530499fb549'></a>

In the event that an individual within the organization finds themselves in a situation that could potentially lead to a conflict between personal and professional interests, they are expected to declare the conflict, seek appropriate approval, and ensure it is duly recorded. To assist in evaluating such situations, individuals are encouraged to reflect on whether they would be comfortable explaining their actions to colleagues, friends, or even the media.

<a id='9a9ca461-98d6-48b1-ad0a-34c7bf173a93'></a>

The Code of Conduct applies to all employees and members of the Board of Directors. It provides clear guidance on identifying, avoiding, and reporting both actual and perceived conflicts of interest.

<a id='fb07a52a-efaa-45a0-9c36-f15b3b2035f9'></a>

In addition, VIL has in place a Related Party Transactions Policy that governs all interactions between the Company and Related Parties. The policy ensures appropriate reporting, approval, and disclosure mechanisms are followed. It also mandates that any Director with an interest in a Related Party Transaction must recuse themselves from discussions or decisions pertaining to such contracts or arrangements, thereby preventing any potential conflict of interest.

necessary, and carrying out assessments based on defined processes. Cross-referencing with customers is also
undertaken on a case-by-case basis. All suppliers are required to comply with VIL's policies, including the Code of
Conduct, Anti-Bribery Policy, Economic Sanctions and Trade Controls, Data Privacy and Protection Policy, Business
Resilience Policy, Information Security Policy, and Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy. (Supplier Onboarding Link:

At Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL), site return materials are systematically classified into four categories: usable, faulty repairable, obsolete, and scrap. Emphasis is placed on maximizing reutilization by repairing and redeploying usable and repairable items. In FY25, VIL successfully redeployed materials worth approximately • 3,035 crores (based on standard prices), reflecting our strong focus on asset optimization and cost efficiency. For materials that are deemed obsolete and beyond repair, VIL adopts a robust and environmentally responsible scrap disposal management process.

# Scrap Management Process

1.  Identification & Segregation:

    Scrap items are first identified by the functional users. These items are then segregated based on:

    *   Material composition: e.g., metal, plastic,
    *   Type of waste: solid, hazardous, e-waste, and plastic

2.  Scrap Note & Disposal:

    A scrap note is prepared and routed through the designated approval workflow within VIL. Once approved, disposal is carried out through authorized scrap vendors—certified by relevant Government/Regulatory bodies and holding necessary licenses. These vendors are responsible for ensuring that the material is handled, disposed of, or repurposed in compliance with environmental and societal regulations.

**Value Engineering Center (VEC) – Pune**
To further enhance value recovery, VIL has set up a dedicated Value Engineering Centre (VEC) in Pune. The VEC specializes in the evaluation and repair of equipment classified as "Repair Not Possible (RNP)" by OEMs. Rather than scrapping such equipments, it is redirected to the VEC for further examination and repair. The center has been proven highly effective, achieving a recovery rate of 70%, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 30% seen with other local repair partners. Approximately, around 9,000 cards are categorized as RNP annually across all clusters. As of March 25, the VEC has delivered a total cost avoidance of ₹49 crore, underscoring its vital role in resource optimization and sustainability.

**Water initiative**

Renovated washrooms at multiple circle offices— including Indore, TNC, and KWB—where we ensured the installation of water-efficient fixtures

Replaced conventional manual dishwashing processes with energy- and water-efficient dishwashers.

Traditional water taps, which typically discharge 2.2 gallons per minute (GPM), were replaced with new fixtures operating at 1.5 GPM, thereby reducing water flow without compromising functionality.

<a id='87f10d9a-78aa-4474-a344-3633f3fbae19'></a>

Handwashing typically consumes 10–15 gallons
of water per cycle, the newly installed dishwashers
operate with only 3–4 gallons per cycle, resulting
in a substantial reduction in water usage and
effluent discharge.

**Independent Auditor's Report**
**To the Members of Vodafone Idea Limited**
**Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements**

<a id='53ca8e6f-fff1-4d22-beaf-3f8e399bb88e'></a>

# Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements
of Vodafone Idea Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and
Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the
Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial
statements, including a summary of material accounting policies
and other explanatory information.

<a id='832f26ea-104f-4907-9bd7-0f1554a822a9'></a>

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, its loss including other comprehensive loss, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

<a id='c1ecea76-403c-415d-befb-e70f10e15187'></a>

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

<a id='fbd02fe8-e7ae-4764-bd0a-ec4882010d77'></a>

# Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern

We draw attention to Note 5 to the standalone financial statements, which describes the Company's financial condition as of March 31, 2025 including its debt obligations due for the next 12 months. The Company's financial performance has impacted its ability to generate cash flows that it needs to settle/refinance its liabilities as they fall due. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on support from the DoT on the AGR matter, successfully arranging funding and generation of cash flow from its operations that it needs to settle its liabilities as they fall due. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

<a id='541b360d-fa72-472b-b3e4-7b8ef3764fe0'></a>

## Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

<a id='8f5a4f13-228c-4fbb-b9f9-906fddbe81a1'></a>

In addition to the matter described in the 'Material Uncertainty
Related to Going Concern' section, we have determined the matters
described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated
in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial
statements section of our report, including in relation to these
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements. The
results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed
to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion
on the accompanying standalone financial statements.

**Other Information**
The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.

<a id='9cb7ca3f-67a5-4a87-8770-62ec788fc35e'></a>

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

<a id='bb88f18e-9ff5-423e-a78c-a03a4ff10341'></a>

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements,
our responsibility is to read the other information identified above
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether such
other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

<a id='ee7c3d1b-e828-4132-9e17-31b133a9b8c9'></a>

**Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements**
The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

<a id='a9c877d9-1fe7-4eb8-9f8a-96e43894126e'></a>

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

<a id='2695fb2f-8132-4d65-9170-e949b2d5280f'></a>

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the
Company's financial reporting process.

<a id='6c6a054a-16d4-498d-9b30-93a128831e77'></a>

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements** Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

<a id='ef79c2f9-76b0-4dd0-98ca-4d23e3778cff'></a>

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

*   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
*   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
*   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
*   Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

The Union Cabinet on September 15, 2021 announced major structural and process reforms in the telecom sector ("Telecom Relief Package 2021") and approved deferment up to four years for AGR dues and spectrum auction instalments payable from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2025 excluding the instalments due for spectrum auction conducted post 2021, without any change in the overall tenure. On October 14, 2021, DoT issued the required notifications giving an option for moratorium of Spectrum instalment and AGR dues to be confirmed by the Company. The Company conveyed its acceptance for the deferment of Spectrum auction instalments & AGR dues by a period of four years. Resultantly, the next AGR instalment of ₹ 164,280 Mn is due on March 31, 2026.

## 6. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a) Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue is recognised when a customer receives services and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain benefits from those services. Revenue is measured at the Transaction price i.e. an amount that reflects the consideration, to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to customers, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Taxes and duties collected by the seller / service provider are to be deposited with the government and not received by the Company on their own account. Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue. The Company evaluates its exposure to significant risks and reward associated with the revenue arrangements in order to determine its position of a principal or an agent in this regard. Consideration payable to a customer includes cash or credit or other items expected to be payable to the customer (or to other parties that purchase the entity's services from the customer). The Company accounts for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction from the transaction price unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct service that the customer transfers to the entity.

<a id='7f9c7fb5-d17e-47ec-b821-7fda7f1fd463'></a>

i) **Revenue from supply of services**

Revenue on account of telephony services (post-paid and prepaid categories, roaming, interconnect and long distance services) is recognised on rendering of services. Fixed Revenues in the post-paid category are recognised over the period of rendering of services. Processing fees on recharge vouchers in case of prepaid category is recognised over the validity of such vouchers.

<a id='1df44fec-5da0-4227-9da5-cc87918d4cde'></a>

Revenue from other services (internet services, mobile advertisement, revenue from toll free services, etc.) is recognised on rendering of services. Revenue from passive infrastructure is recognised on rendering of services.

<a id='e4a17849-b169-462d-8cea-ad3342543a83'></a>

If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

<a id='44f38ca0-940e-4a42-b8a6-e9844366b262'></a>

**Multiple element contracts:**
Bundle packages that include multiple elements, at the inception of the arrangement, the Company determines whether it is necessary to separate the separately identifiable elements and apply the corresponding revenue recognition policy to each element. Total package revenue is allocated among the identified elements based on their relative standalone price.

<a id='10c47929-74b7-4413-a039-9e85e83d25cb'></a>

ii) **Unbilled income**

Unbilled income is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs its obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer before the same is

invoiced to the customer, unbilled income is
recognised for the earned consideration that
is conditional on satisfaction of performance
obligation.

<a id='71d18fa2-c83e-4932-9bd3-551cff4d47e0'></a>

iii) **Trade receivables**
A trade receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in note 6(q) Financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent measurement.

iv) **Advance from customer and deferred revenue**
Advance from customer and deferred revenue is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has invoiced / received consideration from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made. Advance from customer and deferred revenue are recognised as revenue when the Company fulfils its performance obligations under the contract.

v) **Interest income**
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is recorded using the applicable Effective Interest Rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.

vi) **Dividend**
Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established.

<a id='5651f0e2-130f-49e1-a16d-b58ffd0d95d7'></a>

**vii) Cost to obtain a contract**
The Company pays sales commission to
its channel partners for each contract that
they obtain and incurs customer verification
expenses. Such costs are deferred over
the average expected customer life-cycle
provided the estimated average customer
life-cycle is higher than twelve months. The
Company re-estimates the average customer
life cycle on a periodic basis.

<a id='00084541-2f10-4f45-876a-16585ac9504d'></a>

**b) Leases**
The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

<a id='b4519058-7f10-41b4-917f-11064ec2c8b1'></a>

**Company as a lessee**

The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for passive infrastructure for cell sites and immovable properties.

<a id='a00a98bf-3405-4e92-b340-0c38d673e8de'></a>

i) **Right-of-use assets**
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

<a id='f13365a9-13d2-4f12-8407-32a7f0001ca4'></a>

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

<a id='ed7d17b8-b8a9-400b-bfe4-2d177f2196e2'></a>

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment (Refer note 6(l)).

<a id='f7177c28-e228-47ac-98cc-6d8d2f1d17a5'></a>

ii) **Lease liabilities**

At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

<a id='50fd09bc-582b-49a7-aecd-ad8e12d685f3'></a>

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification i.e. a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The re-measurement of lease liability is done by discounting the revised lease payments using the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of modification.

<a id='aade5d79-b514-4a7a-a1fb-d4dcb735a1c2'></a>

iii) **Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

<a id='bcc4cfd6-803c-4df9-85f0-3aa40f5e0af4'></a>

c) **Employee benefits**
i. **Defined Contribution Plan**

Contributions to Provident and other funds are funded with the appropriate authorities and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

<a id='205bc942-3c59-4e33-a2e9-fcc02bb9dbe4'></a>

Contributions to Superannuation are funded with the Life Insurance Corporation of India and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

<a id='c2a04e93-e0ed-4b87-b6c7-8e2b5c89089a'></a>

The Company has no obligation other than contribution payable to these funds.

<a id='3f0853f0-1a3f-4d62-a3ce-20fd2ec1d2fd'></a>

ii. **Defined Benefit Plan**
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan which is a funded plan. In case of funded plan, the Company makes contribution to a separately administered fund with the Insurance Companies. The Company maintains a target level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimation of the payments. Any deficit in plan assets managed by Insurance Companies as compared to the liability based on an independent actuarial valuation is recognised as a liability. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit

credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at periodic intervals.

<a id='c70fa449-7cb2-4e69-ac6d-02be1518b03c'></a>

Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding charge or credit to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in subsequent periods.

<a id='4b0c6777-9571-4940-af71-b5dbfc814ae3'></a>

Net interest is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net defined benefit
liability or asset. The Company recognises
the following changes in the net defined
benefit obligation as an expense in the
Statement of Profit and Loss:
* Service costs; and
* Net interest expense or income

<a id='80b6ebb7-890a-4e82-89f9-34acbf3c739e'></a>

iii. **Short-term and other long-term employee benefits**

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of salaries, wages, Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and other short term employee benefits in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

<a id='8e582c1f-f1e9-4125-98cd-620aed4ce361'></a>

Provision for leave benefits to employees
is based on actuarial valuation done by
projected unit credit method at the reporting
date. The related re-measurements are
recognised in the Statement of Profit and
Loss in the period in which they arise.

<a id='70b84b6b-97b0-4743-91ce-8899c962dbea'></a>

iv. **Share- based payments**
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees for options granted by the Company to its employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.

<a id='7e0bbddb-d291-43a9-aa64-fa4bab4fa60c'></a>

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based payments is expensed over the period in which the performance or service conditions are fulfilled, based on the Company's estimate of stock options that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the cash settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of stock option that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in liability. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve or liability as applicable.

<a id='0283b166-6272-48e2-8fb4-bb4ef21dbbe1'></a>

In respect of cancellation of unvested stock options, the amount already charged as share based payment expense is reversed under the same head in the Statement of Profit and Loss. In respect of cancellation/expiration of vested stock options, the amount already charged as share based payment expense is adjusted against Retained earnings in Other Equity.

<a id='cdb9b974-4113-4f75-a43b-827ec9451e5e'></a>

In respect of modification such as re-pricing
of existing stock option, the difference in fair
value of the option on the date of re-pricing
is accounted for as share based payment
expense over the remaining vesting period.

<a id='7b42ee0c-9fa4-48db-8fd4-b976d793b117'></a>

d) **Annual Revenue Share License Fees and Spectrum Usage Charges**
The license fees and spectrum usage charges, computed basis of adjusted gross revenue, are charged at prescribed rates to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the related revenue arises as per the Unified License / Unified Access Service License and DoT amendments issued from time to time

<a id='54f897c2-c5ce-4c15-8e36-a2974627d72a'></a>

i. **Current tax**
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Current tax is based on the taxable income and calculated using the applicable tax rates and tax laws. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.

<a id='7de48788-91a2-4ef2-9ec1-fa0df36b29d5'></a>

Current tax relating to items recognised
outside profit or loss is recognised outside
profit or loss in correlation to the underlying
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

<a id='e69eeeb7-27bf-46a2-bdd5-31b1dbdbcbf6'></a>

ii. **Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

<a id='523c2521-21a7-41a7-8811-3e199c0423f8'></a>

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
is reviewed at the end of each reporting date
and reduced to the extent it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will
be available to allow the benefit of part or
that entire deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-
assessed at the end of each reporting
date and are recognised to the extent it
has become probable that future taxable
profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be
recovered.

<a id='0f0726f0-de48-49eb-8556-4726dbf7952c'></a>

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the year when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates
and tax laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date.

<a id='17f95063-e65c-4911-96a7-dbd69e90cdec'></a>

Deferred tax relating to items recognised
outside profit or loss is recognised outside
profit or loss in correlation to the underlying
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

<a id='4510416d-4a9e-4217-b0a9-52288e1051c2'></a>

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation statute.

<a id='12af6aae-b467-4f50-ae21-43929e1d57c3'></a>

h) **Current / Non - Current Classification**

An asset is classified as current when

a) It is expected to be realized or consumed in the company's normal operating cycle;

b) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;

c) It is expected to be realized within twelve
months after the reporting period; or

d) If it is cash or cash equivalent, unless it is

after the reporting period.

<a id='bb8e4928-14f0-44d1-a9a3-df9a1d63fdd5'></a>

Any asset not conforming to the above is classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when

a) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle of the company;
b) It is held primarily for the purposes of trading;
c) It is expected to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
d) The company have no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

Any liability not conforming to the above is classified as non-current.

<a id='6189f3c0-2466-4bbc-96c2-4b64cda56ff7'></a>

i) **Property, Plant and Equipment**
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Capital work in progress (CWIP) held for use in the rendering of services and supply of goods, or for administrative purposes, are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation as applicable and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes all direct costs relating to acquisition and installation of Property, Plant and Equipment, non-refundable duties and borrowing cost relating to qualifying assets. CWIP represents cost of property, plant and equipment not ready for intended use as on the reporting date. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as

<a id='dc89c100-f351-4b85-8d62-9b295bda021c'></a>

incurred. The present value of the expected cost
for the decommissioning of an asset after its use
is included in the cost of the respective asset if
the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

<a id='cd995847-1846-4e3f-b8df-41687a27876a'></a>

Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on all other assets under PPE commences once such assets are available for use in the intended condition and location. Depreciation is provided using straight-line method on pro rata basis over their estimated useful economic lives as given below. The useful life is taken as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except where the estimated useful economic life has been assessed to be lower. The depreciation period, residual value and the depreciation method are reviewed periodically.

<a id='ce28ae2e-54b7-4617-ab56-74dea06e2c15'></a>

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) is capitalized when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. ARO is measured based on present value of expected cost to settle the obligation.

Any gains or losses arising from retirement or disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on the date of retirement or disposal.

<a id='450cfbf1-4fd3-48e1-b784-f0a56f115dd5'></a>

j) **Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost includes all direct costs relating to acquisition of Intangible assets and borrowing cost relating to qualifying assets. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

<a id='f251fb6f-deff-437c-9f9f-909df1d9c2e5'></a>

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed
as either finite or indefinite. There are no intangible
assets assessed with indefinite useful life.

<a id='2dba11a5-85ab-4163-9a1e-cb31393f1828'></a>

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period, residual value and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed periodically. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.

<a id='369f07d6-b146-46a0-ace9-3b3d5d1dd796'></a>

Intangible assets are amortised on straight line method as under:

* Cost of spectrum is amortised on straight line method from the date when the related network is ready for intended use over the unexpired period of the spectrum.

<a id='3f4bfdfa-796d-48a0-b58f-1e465a092f7e'></a>

<ul><li>Cost of entry/license fees is amortised on straight line method from the date of launch of circle/renewal of license over the unexpired period of the license.</li><li>Software, which is not an integral part of hardware, is treated as an intangible asset and is amortised over its useful economic life as estimated by the management between 3 to 5 years.</li><li>Brand - Separately acquired brand is shown at historical cost. Subsequently brand is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. The Company amortises brand using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of 8 years.</li></ul>

<a id='8f0236b8-913c-4c2c-be91-66b0b570d676'></a>

Cost of Intangible assets under development represents cost of intangible assets not ready for intended use as on the reporting date. It mainly includes the amount of spectrum allotted to the Company and related borrowing costs (that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets) if any, for which network is not yet ready.

<a id='18621ce0-8ef8-4519-a1a9-9a64be9975e4'></a>

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.

<a id='3c403372-abfd-443d-9715-92213898379e'></a>

k) **Non - Current Assets Held for sale**

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and its sale is highly probable. The sale is considered highly probable only when the asset or disposal groups is available for immediate sale in its present condition, it is unlikely that the sale will be withdrawn and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. These are not depreciated

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are
presented separately in the Balance Sheet.

<a id='5d19a772-ba9f-409d-8c5e-fbf79179f3fb'></a>

Non-current assets that ceases to be classified as held for sale are measured at lower of (i) its carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognised had that asset not been classified as held for sale, and (ii) its recoverable amount at the date when the disposal group ceases to be classified as held for sale.

<a id='062a1b84-abcb-44ce-a25d-f0e062d9f7f3'></a>

I) **Impairment of Non – Financial Assets**

Tangible assets (including Right-to-Use Assets
(ROU)) and Intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of
the asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount
of an individual asset, the Company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
to which the asset belongs.

<a id='ad3ad880-e147-4e8f-b159-94e105293bce'></a>

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less cost of disposal, an appropriate valuation model is used. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss by reducing the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) to its recoverable amount.

<a id='7bff1d6e-89ea-4669-9cab-482e6b5c3e7c'></a>

For assets excluding goodwill, impairment losses recognized in the earlier periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset's (or cash generating unit's) recoverable

<a id='5b6343bc-9949-4a4c-ad2e-7a08c3ee3ca1'></a>

amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the assets' recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had such impairment loss not been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

<a id='0352dd0c-1be9-4f78-b973-7c617fcef47b'></a>

m) **Investment in Subsidiaries, Associate and Joint Arrangements**
The Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries, joint venture and associate at cost less any impairment losses.

n) **Borrowing Costs**
Borrowing Costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

<a id='71ee656e-a940-4630-8a86-db3a8b62b845'></a>

o) **Inventories**

Inventories are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined on weighted average basis and includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

p) **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise of cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the Statement of Cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Company's cash management.

<a id='28db4bac-8d7b-4524-8cc9-74e0062f2b59'></a>

q) **Financial Instruments**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial Instruments (assets and liabilities) are recognised when the Company becomes a party to a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

<a id='1f42720b-dc32-4bc6-b97f-1d0bb743cc19'></a>

Financial instruments are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss as applicable. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than those designated as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to or deducted from the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

<a id='089d1bd3-6efc-4817-85f3-1541aa63f134'></a>

The liability component of a compound financial instrument is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

<a id='4487e8e7-35e9-4d77-ab01-d79728ef02c6'></a>

i. **Financial assets**
All regular way purchase or sale of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchase or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

<a id='ccf7ace9-2165-496e-8e0b-4dc7d48d86ff'></a>

## Subsequent measurement
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets:

a) Financial assets measured at amortised cost
b) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
c) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

<a id='408c462a-7115-4f41-9df0-3fa378a3fd11'></a>

I. **Financial assets measured at amortised cost**
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

*   The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and
*   Contractual terms of the instruments give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

<a id='ecbd11bc-b15b-4d3e-b61a-6e3264fa9558'></a>

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

<a id='7e7424eb-f6af-4067-bfe6-552f25138fb0'></a>

The EIR amortisation is included in other income
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses
arising from impairment are recognised in the
Statement of Profit and Loss. This category

generally applies to trade and other receivables,
loans, etc.

<a id='49ae67bc-4b26-44ce-8870-92c39b38bb1e'></a>

II. **Financial assets measured at FVTPL**

FVTPL is a residual category for financial assets in the nature of debt instruments. Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.

<a id='317aff85-68b4-40e7-93ef-b3d4fe05e54d'></a>

## Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:
* The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
* The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'passthrough' arrangement; and either
    * - the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
    * - the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

<a id='163a110f-6a72-4713-bf91-eb63aeda1e17'></a>

## Impairment of financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:

*   Debt instruments measured at amortised cost e.g., loans and bank deposits
*   Trade receivables
*   Other Financial assets not designated as FVTPL

<a id='a5ad08be-a601-4a24-b540-2af1d4bc7f87'></a>

For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

<a id='7fb1ad76-50e7-4e2c-a89b-73d5bddcc873'></a>

ECL is the difference between all contractual cash
flows that are due to the Company in accordance
with the contract and all the cash flows that the
entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls),
discounted at the original EIR. Lifetime ECL are
the expected credit losses resulting from all
possible default events over the expected life
of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is
a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from
default events that are possible within 12 months
after the reporting date.

<a id='c3b725df-e80c-4342-a781-aa27b57f1c39'></a>

The Company follows 'simplified approach' for
recognition of impairment loss allowance on
Trade receivables (including lease receivables).
The application of simplified approach does not
require the Company to track changes in credit risk.
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance
based on lifetime ECL at each reporting date, right
from its initial recognition.

<a id='1a398e5f-fac7-4ba7-a95c-48e7f7e30cb4'></a>

For the purpose of measuring the expected credit loss for trade receivables, the Company estimates irrecoverable amounts based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Further, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment collectively depending on their significance. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible on assessment of facts and circumstances. Refer note 15.

assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through FVTOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in statement of profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to statement of profit and loss and recognised in other (gains)/losses (net). Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method.

## ii. Financial liabilities

### Subsequent measurement
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method or at FVTPL.

a) **Financial liabilities at amortised cost**
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

<a id='3de9106f-cf23-49fc-9b3c-2805667627ce'></a>

b) **Financial liabilities at FVTPL**

Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL when the financial liabilities are held for trading or are designated as FVTPL on initial recognition. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated

<a id='93f106bf-39f2-4cdd-a99f-f3c944b3833c'></a>

embedded derivatives are also classified as
held for trading unless they are designated
as effective hedging instruments. Gains
or losses on liabilities held for trading are
recognised in the profit or loss.

<a id='9709db27-2258-42ac-951e-4ee638f12913'></a>

# De-recognition
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. In case, an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

<a id='86c9f83d-d64c-4d3e-8040-c6466efb13b4'></a>

### iii. Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks, respectively. These derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for period consistent with currency and interest exposures. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

**Embedded derivatives**
An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid (combined) instrument that also includes a non-derivative host contract - with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative instrument. An embedded derivative causes some

or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.

If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the Company does not separate embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies the classification requirements contained in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments.

<a id='8493ff6a-7ccb-480d-989a-5c00ff1499b2'></a>

iv. **Offsetting financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

<a id='4fad20cb-bb6c-4ac8-b448-2a438f7b06a6'></a>

r) **Fair value measurement**
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

<a id='365167f5-86b1-42be-8a19-13dec8b826b1'></a>

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

<a id='7dd13099-0a7e-4c81-96c0-9cc2b28f1b1d'></a>

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is
measured or disclosed in the financial statements
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy,

<a id='8e145db5-593e-4995-81be-042bf4c94fc6'></a>

described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

*   Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
*   Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
*   Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

<a id='58103755-85e0-4dff-906a-625b2b0d5ed3'></a>

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) (a) on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer or (b) at the end of each reporting period or (c) at the beginning of each reporting period.

<a id='c8788f50-0faf-4b5f-8279-cd86fcf7ddc7'></a>

**s) Dividend distribution to equity holders**

Dividends paid / payable along with applicable taxes are recognised when it is approved by the shareholders. In case of interim dividend, it is recognised when it is approved by the Board of Directors and distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. A corresponding amount is accordingly recognised directly in equity.

<a id='0168d945-9fb8-4db3-9719-8bc05fe2c2b6'></a>

t) **Earnings per share**
The earnings considered in ascertaining the Company's Earnings per share (EPS) is the net profit / (loss) after tax.

<a id='802c026d-b59b-4211-860f-5ce621105a92'></a>

EPS is disclosed on basic and diluted basis. Basic
EPS is computed by dividing the profit / (loss)
for the period attributable to the shareholders of
the Company by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period. The diluted
EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS,
after adjusting for the effects of potential dilutive

<a id='fbc675fc-fea5-4574-b8e2-5b8d8b088376'></a>

u) **Provisions and Contingent Liabilities**

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

<a id='c61a7212-eded-458c-95bc-b30168142bfb'></a>

If the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks
specific to the liability. When discounting is used,
the increase in the provision due to the passage
of time is recognised as a finance cost.

<a id='d7e089cf-60ef-4f8b-9976-1db0650aebaf'></a>

i. **Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)**

ARO is provided for those lease arrangements where the Company has a binding obligation to restore the said location / premises at the end of the period in a condition similar to inception of the arrangement. The restoration and decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of expected costs to settle the obligation using estimated cash flows and are recognised as part of the cost of the particular asset. The cash flows are discounted at a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost. The estimated future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future costs or in the discount rate applied are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset.

<a id='3d9551ae-97f3-4145-b1d8-3c521bfb42fc'></a>

ii. **Contingent Liabilities**
A Contingent Liability is disclosed where
there is a possible obligation or a present
obligation that may, but probably will not,

<a id='1e295bfe-39b9-4991-a917-963928f11925'></a>

require an outflow of resources. Contingent
Assets are not recognised.

<a id='ffe94560-88b0-4853-b6cf-a1546735d9d3'></a>

iii. **Onerous Contract**
An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs (i.e., the costs that the Company cannot avoid because it has the contract) of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.

<a id='f7a1f4cb-3975-4f67-9690-b12ec5469a87'></a>

If the Company has a contract that is onerous,
the present obligation under the contract
is recognised and measured as a provision.
However, before a separate provision for
an onerous contract is established, the
Company recognises any impairment loss
that has occurred on assets dedicated to
that contract.

<a id='99e3eaad-e285-4f26-a524-42ec4ede6427'></a>

v) **Business Combinations**
Business Combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103 'Business Combination'. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method unless the transaction is between entities under common control.

<a id='f9bd4816-129c-454f-8ec9-7eb14e957397'></a>

Business Combinations arising from transfer of interests in entities that are under common control, are accounted using pooling of interest method wherein, assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying value. No adjustment is made to reflect fair values, or recognize any new assets or liabilities other than those required to harmonise accounting policies. The identity of the reserves is preserved and appears in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the financial statements of the transferor.

on operating matters and on allocating resources in evaluating performance. Accordingly, the Company operates only in one reportable segment i.e. Mobility and hence no separate disclosure is required for Segment.

x) **Recent pronouncements**

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (India Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS-117 Insurance Contracts (vide notification no G.S.R 492(E)) and amendments to Ind AS 116- Leases, relating to sale and leaseback transactions (vide notification no G.S.R 554(E)), applicable to the Company on or after April 1, 2024,

<a id='ef499a5b-f9fa-4d4c-9345-f14c21d47ff0'></a>

The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that it does not have any material impact on the Financial Statements of the Company.

<a id='1eae151f-e972-4f4b-a6e4-8bb865af61da'></a>

7. USE OF ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures including the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require an adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. Difference between actual results and estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialise.

<a id='519cea1d-173f-4837-a05a-1f90576cb92c'></a>

The Company has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

<a id='b3470603-59d6-434e-87a1-dd9edb0a3a0c'></a>

## Estimates and Assumptions
i. **Taxes**
The company provide for tax considering the applicable tax regulations and based on reasonable estimates. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns giving due considerations to tax laws and establishes provisions in the event if required as a result of differing interpretation or due to retrospective amendments, if any.

<a id='199df3c0-06fa-44cb-b928-219478e84886'></a>

Deferred tax asset (DTA) is recognized only when
and to the extent there is convincing evidence that
the company will have sufficient taxable profits in
future against which such assets can be utilized.
Significant management judgement is required to
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that
can be recognised, based upon the likely timing
and the level of future taxable profits together with
future tax planning strategies, recent business
performance and developments.

<a id='2e8fae70-a53e-425d-860b-e725705c11f9'></a>

Minimum alternative tax (MAT) is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax and will be able to utilize such credit during the specified period. In the year in which the MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset, the said asset is created by way of a credit to the Statement of Profit and loss and is included in Deferred Tax Assets. The Company review the same at each Balance Sheet date and if required, writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that Company will be able to absorb such credit during the specified period. Further details about taxes refer note 55 and 56.

<a id='84fff48e-9242-4129-9802-84ac69ff128f'></a>

ii. **Defined benefit plans (gratuity and compensated absences benefits)**

The Company's obligation on account of gratuity and compensated absences is determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, attrition rate and

mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved
in the valuation and its long-term nature, these
liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these
assumptions.

<a id='056894ed-6e97-47cf-ac00-76a78af68a81'></a>

All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The parameter subject to frequent changes is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post- employment benefit obligation.

<a id='9ef96f70-ab5d-4406-8ad2-aa3521f79ddf'></a>

The mortality rate is based on publicly available
mortality tables in India. Those mortality tables
tend to change only at interval in response to
demographic changes. Future salary increases are
based on expected future inflation rates.

<a id='34f08e7b-ad1d-46a5-8677-545c10ecba51'></a>

Further details about gratuity obligations are given in note 53 (A).

<a id='06cd5ae2-01c8-48ff-976f-d4cdeccf2532'></a>

### iii. Allowance for Trade receivable

For the purpose of measuring the expected credit loss for trade receivables, the Company estimates irrecoverable amounts based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Further, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment collectively depending on their significance. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible on assessment of facts and circumstances. Refer note 15.

<a id='348f1d47-a795-4a0f-8eca-ba80f0712593'></a>

iv. **Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible assets**

The useful life to depreciate or amortise property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets respectively is based on technical obsolescence, nature of assets, estimated usage of the assets, operating conditions of the asset, and manufacturers' warranties, maintenance and support period, etc. The charge for the depreciation or amortisation is derived after considering the expected residual value at end of the useful life.

<a id='f6ed41af-674a-46b7-9a13-c0bf3e1eb164'></a>

The residual values, useful lives and methods of
depreciation or amortisation of property, plant and

<a id='8857c928-cbef-4874-bfd6-b4f65c39ba2b'></a>

equipment and Intangible assets respectively are reviewed by the management at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively over the remaining useful life.

<a id='53b208d1-b1f4-4f09-861e-97f6155d410a'></a>

v. **Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate**

The Company cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The Company estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain specific estimates such as Company's credit rating.

<a id='9f5e6c5f-f3ac-4cc3-bc67-f2f904b0aae4'></a>

vi. **Leases-Estimate of lease period**
Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised.

<a id='7a12b21b-5c78-4939-b1c1-4c6f094ce02e'></a>

vii. **Provisions and Contingent Liabilities**

Provisions and contingent liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Evaluations of uncertain provisions and contingent liabilities and assets requires judgement and assumptions regarding the probability of realization and the timing and amount, or range of amounts, that may ultimately be incurred. Such estimates may vary from the ultimate outcome as a result of differing interpretations of laws and facts. Refer note 46 for details about Contingent liabilities.

### NOTE 44: SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS / NEW DEVELOPMENTS

i) On July 23, 2018, the Company had paid an amount of ₹ 39,263 Mn under protest for the differential amount of entry fees paid and market determined price of 4.4 Mhz, as demanded by the DoT. The Company had thereafter filed a petition with TDSAT disputing ₹ 13,636 Mn as excess amount calculated by the DoT. Based on probability assessment of ultimate outflow, the Company had capitalised ₹ 39,263 Mn, paid under protest, along with the respective spectrum of the circles and amortised substantially over the balance life of the respective spectrum.

During the previous year, the DoT accepted the Company's contention to the extent of ₹ 7,555 Mn resulting in TDSAT issuing order dated December 15, 2023, directing the DoT to adjust this amount. The DoT vide letter dated December 27, 2023 has communicated such adjustment. Accordingly, the Company has recognised the same as an Exceptional Items in the Statement of Profit and loss in financial year 2023-24.

ii) On October 16, 2023, the Honourable Supreme Court of India pronounced a judgement, on an ongoing litigation, regarding the tax treatment of annual Revenue Share License Fee (RSLF) paid to the DoT since July 1999 and held that it merits the same tax treatment as the upfront fee that is paid at the time of acquisition of a telecom license. The Company has been treating RSLF as revenue expenses for the purpose of taxation. This decision does not result in a permanent disallowance but leads to a staggered allowance of RSLF over the balance period of the license resulting into lower taxable deduction in the initial years of a license and a higher deduction in the later period of the license.

Over the years, the Company has acquired various licenses from the DoT and also acquired companies having telecom licenses and merged these entities into the Company resulting in cancellation of licenses pertaining to those entities on merger. During previous year, based on initial evaluation and after considering the allowable deductions for the periods and on a best estimate basis, a tax provision of ₹ 8,220 Mn and interest of ₹ 2,630 Mn has been recorded under "Current tax" and "Finance costs" respectively, and corresponding effect has been recorded as Current tax liability of ₹ 5,217 Mn and adjusted ₹ 5,633 Mn in Other Non-Current Assets in the financial statements in financial year 2023-24. Due to tax losses carried forward, higher deductions in future periods do not meet the criteria for the recognition of deferred tax assets under Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes. During the current year, on May 17, 2024 the Honourable Supreme Court of India pronounced a further judgement in this regard waiving applicable interest. Based on this judgement, the Company has reversed the accrued interest charge of ₹ 2,630 Mn under finance cost.

On March 18, 2024, in accordance with the terms of the OCDs, ATC requested the Company for conversion of 14,400 OCDs into 1,440,000,000 fully paid-up Equity Shares and accordingly, on March 23, 2024, the Company allotted 1,440,000,000 equity shares of face value of ₹ 10/- each at an issue price of ₹ 10/- per equity share to ATC.

During the current year, on July 11, 2024, ATC requested the Company for conversion of balance 1,600 OCDs into 160,000,000 fully paid-up Equity Shares and accordingly, on July 12, 2024, the Company allotted 160,000,000 equity shares of face value of ₹ 10/- each at an issue price of ₹ 10/- per equity share to ATC.

All the above preferential issue proceeds have been utilised in accordance with the issue object(s) as stated in respective offer document.

vi) The DoT conducted auctions for various spectrum bands which got concluded on June 26, 2024. The Company successfully bid for 50 MHz of spectrum (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2500 MHz) in 11 circles at a total cost of ₹ 34,967 Mn. The validity of the spectrum is for a period of 20 years starting from the effective date as per the Frequency Assignment Letter for Respective Service Areas. The Company has made the upfront payment of ₹ 3,315 Mn and based on the available payment options, the Company has opted for the deferred payment option for balance amount. The Company has capitalised the cost under "Intangible Assets".

vii) The Implementation Agreement (IA) entered between the parties defines a settlement mechanism between the Company and the promoters of erstwhile Vodafone India Limited ("VInL") for any cash inflow/outflow that could possibly arise to/by the Company towards settlement of certain outstanding disputes pertaining to the period until May 31, 2018. Based on the AGR judgement from Hon'ble SC in October 2019, the Company had recognised a receivable of ₹ 83,694 Mn, being the cap under the IA, as the AGR liability which was contingent at the time of the merger, got crystalized following this judgement.

Basis the discharge of AGR liability by the Company until March 2020, VInL promotors had paid ₹ 19,750 Mn as per the IA in April 2020 and hence, the net settlement amount receivable by VIL was reduced to ₹ 63,939 Mn. The settlement of such assets recognized was to happen periodically based on outflow towards AGR dues, as defined in the Implementation Agreement for the period June 2020 to June 2025 (Settlement period).

Under the IA, the Company can claim the amounts should it discharge part of the AGR dues by 30th June 2025. However, considering the moratorium by GoI, these amounts have not been paid by the Company. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the parties have agreed to extend the settlement date from June 30, 2025 to September 30, 2025. The Company believes that it will be able to realise this asset.

viii) One Time Spectrum Charges (Beyond 4.4 MHz):

During the financial year 2012-13, the DoT had issued demand notices towards one time spectrum charges (hereinafter referred to as "OTSC"). The demands on the Company i.e. formerly Idea Cellular Limited have been challenged by way of writ petition before the Bombay High Court (BHC). The erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (VInL) and erstwhile Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (VMSL) had challenged the demands before the TDSAT. The grounds taken before BHC and TDSAT were different though.

On July 4, 2019 TDSAT in its judgement quashed the demands levied on erstwhile VInL and VMSL and inter alia held that:

- For spectrum up to 6.2 MHz, OTSC is not chargeable and accordingly demand set aside.
- For spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz,
  - Allotment after July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from the date of allotment of such spectrum.
  - Allotment before July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from January 1, 2013 till the date of expiry of license.
  - Conditions as stated in para 1 (v) of the impugned order dated December 28, 2012 (given hereunder) is arbitrary and illegal and is accordingly set aside, i.e. Upfront charges in the case of spectrum holding in multiple bands (900 MHz and 1800 MHz), spectrum in 1800 MHz band will be accounted for first, towards the limit of 4.4 MHz was held to be arbitrary and illegal and accordingly set aside.

Thereafter the Company filed an appeal before the Honourable Supreme Court against the TDSAT judgement. On March 16, 2020, Honourable Supreme Court dismissed the petition filed by the Company challenging the levy of OTSC beyond 6.2 MHz. Following the dismissal of the Company's appeal by the Honourable Supreme Court on March 16, 2020, the Company is yet to receive any demand from the DoT in line with the TDSAT order. The DoT preferred an appeal against the entire TDSAT judgement and sought
