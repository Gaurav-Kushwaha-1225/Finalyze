* Net working capital was managed very well, ending the year below our 14% target level largely due to timing of product purchases.
* Maintained healthy inventory levels at December 31, 2024, which were reduced by US$44 million from December 31, 2023, following the push last year to ensure sufficient inventory to capture the strong travel demand in 2023.

Accounts payable were higher than normal mainly due to timing of product purchases at the end of the year as we prepurchased some additional inventory in our North America region to mitigate potential tariff exposure risk, as well as the timing of Chinese New Year.

* Travel trends are expected to remain robust over the next several years, which we believe will support long-term growth in our business.
* Our year-over-year constant currency net sales performance improved sequentially across our regions in Q4 2024 relative to Q3 2024, however the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which is impacting consumer sentiment.
* As a result, net sales for Q1 2025 are expected to be approximately down low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2024. We are anticipating sequential net sales improvement over the rest of 2025.
* We are confident that our investments in new and exciting products, brand elevation, and channel and product category expansion will drive long-term growth, while maintaining our robust margin profile supported by disciplined expense management.
* We will continue to leverage our asset-light business model to maintain strong adjusted free cash flow(1) generation. We will focus on investing in growth, returning cash to our shareholders, and deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.
* We continue to make great progress on "Our Responsible Journey" and look forward to publishing our annual report on our industry-leading initiatives in April 2025.
* Our preparations for a potential dual listing of the Company's securities in the United States continue to progress. Our Board of Directors and management believe this process will enhance value creation over time for our shareholders by increasing trading volumes and making our securities more accessible to investors in the U.S. and globally.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

<a id='ab4ff14e-0df5-4a0c-8607-f778d4d85ea2'></a>

In addition to the Company's results determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, management reviews certain non-IFRS financial measures, including constant currency net sales growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow as detailed in this section to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting the Company, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.

<a id='6a188d45-ed2b-41f1-a2ba-9daa84069be4'></a>

The Company believes that these non-IFRS financial measures, when used in conjunction with the IFRS Accounting Standards financial information, allow investors to better evaluate the Company's financial performance in comparison to other periods and to other companies in the industry. However, non-IFRS financial measures are not defined or recognized under IFRS Accounting Standards, are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or relied on as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The Company's presentation of any non-IFRS financial measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Other companies in the Company's industry may calculate non-IFRS financial measures differently, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures.

<a id='0c3f469c-faa5-4225-8d24-6da5db4559de'></a>

Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Company's results under IFRS Accounting Standards. Constant currency net sales growth is limited as a metric to review the Company's financial results as it does not reflect the impacts of foreign currency on reported net sales. Some of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin include not capturing certain tax payments that may reduce cash available to the Company; not reflecting any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; not reflecting changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and not reflecting the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments. Some of the limitations of adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share include not capturing the effect of a number of costs, charges and credits and certain other non-cash charges, along with their respective tax effects, that impact reported profit. Some of the limitations of adjusted free cash flow include that it does not reflect future contractual commitments or consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements and does not represent the total increase or decrease in the Company's cash balance for a given period. Because of these and other limitations, these non-IFRS financial measures should be considered along with comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

<a id='ff316be3-ab78-48b8-88c4-c49533822e7f'></a>

**Constant Currency Net Sales Growth**
The Company presents the percent change in constant currency net sales to supplement its net sales presented in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and to enhance investors' understanding of its global business performance by excluding the positive or negative year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on reported net sales. To present this information, current and comparative prior year results for entities with functional currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars by applying the average exchange rate of the year under comparison to current year local currency results rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. The Company believes presenting constant currency information provides useful information to both management and investors by isolating the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results.

* Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Reconciliation

<a id='f07777ef-2ca4-4b20-9888-3a97bcbbbcce'></a>

Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effect of a number of costs, charges and credits and certain other non-cash charges. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit for the period/year, adjusted to eliminate income tax expense, finance costs (excluding interest expense on lease liabilities), finance income, depreciation, amortization (excluding amortization of lease right-of-use assets), share-based compensation expense, impairment reversals and other expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide additional information that is useful in gaining a more complete understanding of its operational performance and of the underlying trends of its business.

<a id='c05504d2-92d5-405c-8e5d-d70acc977c05'></a>

For the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2024

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded adjusted EBITDA of US$194.9 million, an increase of US$13.9 million, or 7.7%, from US$181.0 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended December 31, 2024, was 20.7%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a 30-basis point increase in gross profit margin and a 150-basis point reduction in marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales.

<a id='792ae011-c1c5-45f4-8e8a-a34dd335f6fd'></a>

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Reconciliation

<a id='2b391323-6bef-4edd-bea6-c799364e8c20'></a>

**For the Year Ended December 31, 2024**

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by US$26.3 million, or 3.7%, to US$683.0 million, from US$709.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Because of the year-over-year improvement in gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA margin was only 30 basis points lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, notwithstanding the year-over-year decrease in net sales in 2024.

<a id='5c7ae3df-f9e5-41bf-9a65-5d36bdb46f51'></a>

The following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the Company's profit for the year and profit margin, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

* Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Margin Reconciliation

<a id='2529d500-5611-427f-95e8-d896f6de7034'></a>

Adjusted net income eliminates the effect of a number of costs, charges and credits and certain other non-cash charges, along with their respective tax effects, that impact the Company's reported profit attributable to equity holders, which the Company believes helps to give securities analysts, investors and other interested parties a more complete understanding of its underlying financial performance. Adjusted net income is defined as profit attributable to equity holders, adjusted to eliminate changes in the fair value of put options included in finance costs, amortization of intangible assets, derecognition of deferred financing costs associated with refinancing, impairment reversals, restructuring charges or reversals and tax adjustments. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations, respectively.

<a id='882115c9-ca44-4906-a907-e5920660bee2'></a>

**For the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2024**

Adjusted net income increased by US$20.3 million, or 21.2%, to US$116.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to US$95.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share were US$0.082 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to US$0.066 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease in adjusted net income was primarily due to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by the increase in gross profit margin. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share were US$0.256 and US$0.254 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to US$0.272 and US$0.270 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

*   Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation

<a id='1b2ead17-48fe-4ffc-aab9-c4b42f5c2ac1'></a>

Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash generated from operating activities, less (i) purchases of property, plant and equipment and software and (ii) principal payments on lease liabilities. The Company believes adjusted free cash flow provides helpful additional information regarding the Company's liquidity and its ability to generate cash after excluding the use of cash from certain of its core operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since it excludes certain mandatory expenditures, and adjusted free cash flow may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
